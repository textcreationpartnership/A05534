            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<note place="margin">The power of the Church.</note> and mans ſaluation, bee eyther expreſſely, or by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie conſequence, contayned in the written Word, yet the particular circumſtances of perſons by whom, place where, time when, and of the forme and order how the worſhip and worke of the Miniſtrie ſhould be performed, are neither expreſſely nor by neceſſarie conſequence ſet downe in the Word: but for determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of theſe, ſome generall rules are giuen, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the which the Church hath power to define whatſoeuer is moſt expedient to be obſerued, and done for the honour of God,
<note place="margin">The power of the Chriſtian Church in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors.</note> and edification. This is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue wherein the Chriſtian Church differs from the Iewiſh Synagogue, as is manifeſt in euery one of the particulars aboue expreſſed. Firſt, as touching the perſons, in the Iewiſh Church, they who were imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Miniſtrie, were particularly deſigned to bee Leuies Tribe:
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Numb. cap.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.</note> In the Chriſtians Church neither Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, Nation, nor People, is ſeparated for the worke of the Goſpell, but the qualities, graces, and gifts of men meete for the ſacred ſeruice, are onely ſet downe, and it is in the power of the Church to trie the perſons par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in whom theſe graces and gifts are, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly to elect them. And albeit the function where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto they are called be diuine, yet the bounds within which, and the perſons towards whom the ſame muſt be exerciſed, is limited by the Church, which hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided national Churches in Prouinces &amp; Dioceſes, and Dioceſes in Pariſhes: ſo as both the election of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and the limitation of their juriſdiction, is from
<pb facs="tcp:26266:3"/>the power of the Church. This the Apoſtle calls the meaſure of the Canon,
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.</note> which God did meaſure out to him, beyond the which, he did not reach in his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtleſhip: and ſuch a rule, and meaſure ſhould euery Paſtor in the Church haue, beyond the which, hee ought not to paſſe, entering vpon other mens labour. As the Apoſtles had their meaſure diſtributed to them by God, ſo now euerie Paſtor hath his bounds deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, vnder the Law,
<note place="margin">Their power in conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting places. <hi>Act.</hi> 15.21.</note> albeit the Iewiſh Church had libertie to build Synagogues for their ordinarie meetings on the Sabbath to prayer, and reading of the Law: yet the place, where the chiefe, and ſolemne worſhip of God was performed, was firſt the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, and the Temple, both built by Gods owne ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall direction,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.4.</note> and hauing the principall parts of his worſhippe ſo appropriated to them, that in another place, the ſame might not be performed. But as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel men ſhall neither worſhip God in this mountaine (ſaies our Sauiour) nor in Ieruſalem, but the true worſhippers ſhall worſhip him in truth and ſpirit, the Chriſtian Church hath power according to that Apoſtolicall Rule,
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40.</note> Let all things be done decent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in order, to make choice of a place conuenient, within the bounds of each Pariſh, for the meeting of the faithfull to performe all the points, and parts of Gods worſhip: and this place being built, and dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the worſhip of God, may not bee condemned, neglected, nor profaned, but frequented, and kept for religious vſes. Not that wee eſteeme that there is any more holineſſe in it, then in another place, or that Gods preſence, and ſo his worſhip is annexed more to that
<pb facs="tcp:26266:4"/>place then to another, but to the end religious Seruice may be performed decently, and in order, this is done.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">The power of the Church in appointing times to Gods worſhip. <hi>Leuit.</hi> 23.</note> vnder the Law the chiefe parts of Gods worſhip were aſtricted to certaine ſet times, &amp; feſtiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, &amp; lawfully could not be performed on other daies: but vnder the Goſpel <hi>omnis dies Domini eſt, omnis hora, omne te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pus habile eſt diuinocultui,</hi> as <hi>Tertul.</hi> in his book <hi>de Baptiſmo</hi> witneſſeth; and <hi>Eſay</hi> prophecied in his 66.23.

<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Epiſt. ad Ianuar.</hi> 118.</note> S. <hi>Augustine</hi> affirmes, That in his time men receiued the Sacrament euerie day. Our owne Church, beſides the Lords day, hath appointed other houres and times for diuine Seruice in great Townes, as houres for Morning and Euening Prayer euery day, for Preaching, and interpretation of Scripture, ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times as they hold to bee conuenient. Thus is it manifeſt, that the Church hath power to appoint o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſet times beſides the Lords day, for his ſeruice, as wel by the liberty which God hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to his Church to come, and worſhip before him euery day, as by the practiſe of the Apoſtolicall, and Primitiue Churches. Yea further, the Church hath power to appoint religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous exerciſes, and certaine ſpeciall parts of diuine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
<pb facs="tcp:26266:4"/>to be performed in the times, which ſhee thinkes moſt expedient for edification. So hath our Church bin accuſtomed to appoint particular Scriptures to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted vpon the daies ſo called of Exerciſe; and by the firſt Booke of Diſcipline, euery Paſtor is ordained to teach in his Congregation on the Sondaies at after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noones certaine heads of the Catechiſme: Likewiſe to miniſter the Sacrament of the Communion vpon the firſt Sondaies of March, Iune, Septemb. &amp; December. It was the cuſtom of the Church of <hi>Geneua,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caluin.</hi> 361. <hi>Epiſt.</hi>
               </note> in the daies of <hi>I. Caluin,</hi> to celebrate that holy action vpon the day of the Natiuitie, which wee call Yule, and vpon Eaſter day which we call <hi>Paſche.</hi> The ground of this power is firſt, the aboliſhing of the New-moones, Feſtiual daies, and Sabbaths by the coming of our Sauiour, in whom the body of all theſe ſhadows is: and next, the libertie giuen by God to the Chriſtian Church mentioned by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> as ye heard before. For as by the firſt we are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the bondage of the Law, and the obſeruation of the ſet times therein preſcribed; ſo by the ſecond, all times are ſanctified to the worſhip of God, in ſo farre, that the Chriſtian Church may make choyce of any time in the weeke, any day in the moneth or yeere for their publique meetings to his worſhip. And as for the Lords Day, which hath ſucceeded to the Iewiſh Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, albeit God hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to ſanctifie it by the publike exerciſe of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet neither is the whole pub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/> like worſhip nor any part of it appropriated to that time, but lawfully the ſame may be performed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any other conuenient day of the weeke, of the Moneth, or of the yere, as the Church ſhall think expedient. Vpon this ground <hi>Zanchius</hi> affirmed, <hi>Eccleſiae Chriſti liberu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſſe, quos velit praeter dominic, dies ſibi ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctifica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dos delige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:26266:5"/>And by this warrant did the primitiue Church ſanctifie theſe fiue anniuerſarie dayes, of Chriſts Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie, Paſſion, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, and the Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of the Holy Ghoſt. Where it is obiected, that it is onely proper to God to make holidayes, I anſwer. That it is onely proper to God, to make times, and places holy, by appropriating to them a diuine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which may not bee performed lawfully, but in theſe places, and on theſe times; ſuch as the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, and Temple, and the Iewiſh Feſtiuities vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law were: for vnto them was appropriated by God a worſhip, which might not be performed on another day: and ſo theſe dayes did not only belong to the worſhip as meere circumſtances, but were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per parts or points thereof, and could not bee omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, without marring of the whole action: In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, theſe dayes were holier then other dayes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a part of Gods worſhip conſiſted in obſeruation of them. Such holy dayes the Church cannot make. But to make times and places holy by conſecration of them to an holy vſe, the Church hath power: for the dayes that ſhe appoints are obſerued only for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and policie; and haue no relation to the worſhip performed on them, as any Rite or religious Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie belonging neceſſarily to the integritie thereof. The Natiuitie of our Sauiour may bee remembred, and publike thankes giuen to God therefore vpon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time as well, as vpon the twentie fiue of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;</hi> likewiſe the Paſſion, Aſcenſion, and the reſt of theſe benefits: yet wee remember them at certaine ſet times, not becauſe the times require ſuch a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or the worſhip ſuch a time to the integritie and
<pb facs="tcp:26266:5"/>lawfulneſſe thereof, but to the end the worſhip may be performed orderly once euery yeare, in euery place vpon one day, that all people, whereſoeuer they be, at home or abroad, may bee inſtructed, and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to prayſe and magnifie the grace of God, and goodneſſe of their Sauiour. Herein the reformed Churches differ from the Papiſts, who Iudaize in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of thoſe Feſtiuities, becauſe they profeſſe to obſerue them, not for order only, but eſteeme them to be <hi>ſacratiores &amp; ſanctiores alijs diebus,

                     <hi>Bellar. de cultu ſanctorum, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 10.</note> &amp; pars diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni cultus,</hi> which we doe not. For the Lords Day, it hath ſucceeded to the Sabbath, and is holy by diuine Inſtitution, hauing for euidence and confirmation thereof, both a morall Precept, and the exemplarie practice of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles in Scripture. In the forth command, after the labour of ſix dayes, the ſeuenth is appointed to bee ſanctified in memoriall of Gods reſt from his ſix dayes worke; and the particular day, not being expreſſed in the command, was notified to the people either by the exemplary practice of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and the Church in the Wilderneſſe, or by tradition of the Fathers going before, if ſo it be, that from the Creation that day was obſerued. Now after the legall ſhaddowes are aboliſhed, whereof the Iewiſh Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was one, if any will demand what day muſt bee obſerued in the Chriſtian Church, wee anſwere, that queſtionleſſe for the quotient of the number, the day cannot bee altered, which by the Law is appointed. <hi>Heauen and Earth ſhall periſh, but one iot of the Law ſhall not periſh.</hi> Our Sauiour came not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue the Law, but to fulfill it. In the Law wee heare that God reſted the ſeuenth Day, that he bleſſed and
<pb facs="tcp:26266:6"/>ſanctified it, and there is a libertie giuen to labour ſix dayes, but the ſeuenth is commanded to be kept ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: ſo howbeit the Iewiſh Sabbath which was the ſhaddow, be materially aboliſhed as touching the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Day, yet the Day commanded in the Law, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally muſt remayne, and euer be the ſeuenth after ſix dayes worke. But if yee will aske, ſeeing the ſeuenth Day in particular is not expreſſed in the Law, and that day which the Iewes obſerued, is aboliſhed by Chriſt, as the ſhaddow by the body, how the particular and materiall Day may bee knowne, that the Chriſtian Church ſhould obſerue? Vnto this we anſwere, that the particular Day was demonſtrated by our Sauiours Reſurrection, and his Apparitions made thereon; by the Apoſtolicall practice and the perpetuall obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, euer ſince that time, of the Day which in Scripture is called the Lords Day, as that, which the Iewes obſerued was called the Lords Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; becauſe as the one was appointed by the Lord, for a memoriall of his reſt, after the Creation, ſo the other was inflituted by the Lord for a memoriall of his Reſurrection after the Redemption. For this wee muſt hold as a ſure ground, whatſoeuer the Catholike Church hath obſerued in all Ages, and is found in Scripture expreſly to haue beene practiſed by Chriſt, and the Apoſtles (ſuch as the ſanctification of the Lords Day) the ſame moſt certainly was inſtituted by the Lord to bee obſerued, and his practice in that is exemplar, and hath the ſtrength of a particular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. Hereby it is manifeſt, that the ſanctification of the Lords Day is of diuine Inſtitution, as well by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the diuine Precept, commanding the ſeuenth
<pb facs="tcp:26266:6"/>Day in generall to bee obſerued, as of the diuine pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Chriſt, and the Apoſtles their ſpecifying the Day, which hath the force of a particular diuine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. In reſpect whereof, the obſeruation of this Day is a point of diuine Worſhip, and is holy, not by Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Conſtitution, but by diuine Inſtitution. Moreouer this Day is holy by appropriation of it to a certaine religious vſe, whereunto no other Day can be applyed, namely, to bee a memoriall of the Lords reſt after the Creation, and of his Reſurrection after the Redemption: As alſo to be a ſigne of our ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation here, and of our glorification hereafter, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by the words of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.13. <hi>It ſhall be a ſigne betweene me and you, that I the Lord doe ſanctifie you:</hi> and that of the fourth to the <hi>Hebrewes, A reſt is left to the people of God, wherein we ſhould ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to enter.</hi> For this wee muſt hold, that whatſoeuer vſe vnder the Law, was proper to the Iewes Sabbath, wherein now vnder the Goſpell both Iew and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile haue intereſt, remaynes yet proper to the Lords Day that ſucceeded thereto: And in that reſpect, this Day differs from all other Dayes being obſerued not for policie and order only, but for diuine inſtitution, and the religious vſe whereunto it is appropriate, that is, to bee a memoriall, Firſt of the Creation, as hath beene ſaid, becauſe after our ſixe dayes worke, we reſt on it, being the ſeuenth, as God did from the workes of the Creation: Secondly, of the Redemption, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe on it the Lord aroſe, and perfected that worke: and thirdly, to be a ſigne of our ſanctification, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that God, who hath choſen and ſanctified vs to be his people, and whom we worſhip, is God the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
<pb facs="tcp:26266:7"/>who in ſixe dayes created the World, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the ſeuenth; and God the Redeemer, who roſe on this Day, and hauing aboliſhed ſinne, and death, did bring in righteouſneſſe, and life; and God the holy Ghoſt, by whoſe power hee did riſe, and by whoſe power we hope alſo to be raiſed againe. Vnto this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and religious vſe, this Day is appropriated, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto no other Day beſides can bee applyed. That to conclude, the Church hath power to appoint times, for the publike worſhip of God, and to appoint ſuch a kind of worſhip, as ſhee thinketh moſt expedient to bee vſed on theſe times for edification; although ſhee hath no power to make the obſeruation of any time, a point of Gods worſhip, or to appropriate thereto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of his worſhip.</p>
            <p>Finally, to end this point of the power of the Church, when the people are conuened in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie place, and at the times appointed, the Scripture hath not ſet downe, whereat the Paſtour ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne, how hee ſhould proceed, and wherewith hee ſhould cloſe vp this Seruice: as whether hee ſhould beginne with ſinging of Pſalmes, or praying, or reading, or preaching; and when hee prayes, with what petition he ſhall beginne, what he ſhall ſubioyne next, and ſo forth: what order he ſhall obſerue in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing and celebration of the Supper, in Marriage, in cenſuring of notorious offenders by Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in Abſolution: and to bee ſhort, in all ſuch other points of Doctrine, Diſcipline, and Diuine Seruice, there is nothing particularly preſcribed. Although the ſubſtance of all be in the Word, yet the order, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, forme, and manner are left to be determined
<pb facs="tcp:26266:7"/>by the Church. Many of which points, are of farre greater moment, then any of the Articles concluded at Perth.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the power of the Church. We come now to the extent of this power. It is certaine, that this power cannot reach to any thing eſſentiall or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall in the worſhip of God: but to the decencie,
<note place="margin">The Church hath power to determine ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for Gods worſhip.</note> and order only, which is to bee obſerued for edification in the circumſtances aboue ſpecified; <hi>Let all things bee done decently, and in order,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. The things themſelues that are to be done, are partly ſpecified in that ſame Chapter where this rule is giuen, and in the word elſe-where, they are fully and particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and not left to be preſcribed according to the will and iudgement of the Church, but by this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a power is giuen only to the Church to preſcribe the decent manner, forme, and order how they ſhould be done. And ſo to determine the circumſtances which are in the generall neceſſary to bee vſed in diuine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but not particularly defined in the Word. So by warrant of this Precept, the Church hath no power to forme new Articles of Faith, new Precepts of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, new Petitions of Prayer, new Sacraments, or new Rites, and Ceremonies, ſuch as Salt, Oyle, Spittle, Chriſme, Aſhes, holy Water, Lights, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable ſuch other things; which cannot be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to any circumſtances, that in the generall are of neceſſary vſe: wherein the Church of Rome abuſing her libertie, hath laid vpon the Chriſtian Church a burthen of Rites no leſſe intollerable then the Legall Ceremonies, yea, and haue impoſed them to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, not onely as things belonging to policie, and
<pb facs="tcp:26266:8"/>order, but as parts of diuine worſhip, which we of the reformed Church reiect, eſteeming all that to bee <hi>will worſhip,</hi> which men impoſe to be obſerued, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie points of the ſeruice of God, which himſelfe hath ordayned in his Word.</p>
            <p>Further,
<note place="margin">The Lawes that the Church makes in their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</note> becauſe the Ceremonies and circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces left to the determination of the Church, cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be one and the ſame, by reaſon of the diuerſity of Ages, Times, People, and Nations, touching them no conſtant Law can bee ſet downe, as is acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the one and twentieth Article of the Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Faith confirmed by Parliament; but altered they may be, and altered they ſhould be, when neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie requires: In which caſe Charitie (ſayes <hi>Caluine)</hi> can beſt iudge, what is moſt expedient, <hi>Hanc ſi mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratricem patiemur, ſalua erunt omnia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The power of the Church being thus limited,
<note place="margin">The obedience due to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the Church.</note> it is without controuerſie, that the Canons made by her touching the circumſtances that in the generall are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the worſhip of God, ought to bee obeyed ſo long as they ſtand vnchanged or abrogated: not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they contayne in them any ſubſtantiall or mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall part of Religion, or that they haue in them any diuine Authoritie, as the Commandements of God, which in conſcience bind to obedience; but becauſe in them an order is eſtabliſhed tending to vnitie and peace, whereby confuſion, ſcandall, and Schiſme is eſchewed: and becauſe the power of the Church, whereby theſe Lawes are made, is the Ordinance of God, and confirmed by the authoritie of his Word, commanding vs to obey them that are ſet ouer vs in the Lord, the Canons of the Church muſt be obeyed,
<pb facs="tcp:26266:8"/>for reuerence of the Ordinance and Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, which is the onely direct and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate obiect of our conſcience, and the religious band that tyes vs to the obedience of euery humane ordinance for conſcience ſake.</p>
            <p>But becauſe many excuſe their diſobedience with a pretext of conſcience, I will ſhortly ſet downe the rules of conſcience, that by the Word of God we are obliged to follow in our actions.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, whatſoeuer is commanded,
<note place="margin">The rules of Conſcience.</note> or forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the Word expreſly, or by neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, ought to be obeyed. The next is, whatſoeuer is commanded or forbidden by the Lawes and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of our Superiours Ciuill or Eccleſiaſtique, the ſame, if it be not contrarie to Gods Word, ſhould be <q>obeyed, by reaſon of his expreſſe command; Obey them that haue the rule ouer you, and ſubmit your ſelues, <bibl>
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.</bibl>
               </q> And againe, <q>Submit your ſelfe to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ordinance of man, for the Lords ſake, <bibl>1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13.</bibl>
               </q> To this appertaynes lawfull cuſtoms hauing the force of a Law, where there is no written Law. Thirdly, touching things that are free, and are neither deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by Ciuill nor Eccleſiaſticall Conſtitutions, we haue this rule: <hi>Let euery man ſtand fully perſwaded, in his owne minde, that he may doe or omit that which hee intends, without the offence of God or his Neighbour, but hee that doubts is damned, for whatſoeuer is not of Faith, is ſinne, Rom.</hi> 14. Theſe are the rules of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſet downe in the Word, concerning which it is to be obſerued, that the firſt rule is abſolute, and the ſecond and third ſubiect to it. The Lawes of men and their opinions muſt be tryed, and iudged by the Law
<pb facs="tcp:26266:9"/>of God; for as the Apoſtle ſayes,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 5.29.</note> that is, We muſt obey God rather then men. As for the priuate iudgement of euery mans conſcience, it is ſubiect to both the two former rules. That the iudgement of our minde muſt giue place to Gods Law, no man doubts: And that it ought to giue place vnto Conſtitutions Ciuill or Eccleſiaſtical, no man ſhould doubt, that knowes how God by his Word hath ordayned, that euery ſoule ſhould be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to ſuperiour powers. It may be obiected, What if wee doubt, whether the thing commanded in the law of man bee lawfull and expedient, may wee obey thus doubting, ſeeing the Apoſtle ſayes, that What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is not of Faith is ſinne? Vnto this the anſwer is caſie; firſt, touching the lawfulneſſe of that which is commanded in a Law, no man ought to doubt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept hee bee able to proue euidently that the Law is vnlawfull by the Law of God; which if hee doe, hee muſt follow the firſt rule, and rather obey God then men. Next, as for expedience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14: The things committed to the iudgement of our conſcience, and which according to our faith and perſwaſion wee ought to doe, or omit, are not things determined or concluded by any diuine or humane Conſtitution, but ſuch things as are free and indifferent, which a man may freely elect or reiect,
<note place="margin">In matters of expedience where a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Ordinance is ſet downe, the ſame ought to be the rule of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note> doe or leaue vndone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tranſgreſſion of any Law Diuine, Ciuill, or Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall. In ſuch things, the Apoſtle willeth euery man to follow that which hee thinks moſt expedient for edification, and eſchuing of ſcandall. Where a man hath not a Law, his iudgement is the rule of his conſcience; but where there is a Law, the Law muſt
<pb facs="tcp:26266:9"/>be the rule. As for example, before that Apoſtolicall Canon that forbad to eate bloud, or ſtrangled things, euery man might haue done that which in his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he thought moſt expedient, according to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of times, places, and perſons. In preſence of the Iewes hee might haue abſtayned from theſe things, if in his heart hee thought it moſt expedient, for eſchuing their offence: Contrariwiſe, in preſence of conuerted Gentiles, he might haue eaten, if hee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, that by his abſtinence they would haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken offence, and doubted of their Chriſtian libertie; but after the making and publication of the Canon that inioyned abſtinence, the ſame was to rule their conſciences. And therefore, after that time, albeit a man had thought in his owne priuate iudgement, that to abſtayne from theſe things was not expedient, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome by his abſtinence might haue taken of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence as before; yet in that caſe he ought not to haue eaten, becauſe now the will of the Law, and not the iudgement of his owne mind, was the rule of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Neither was hee now to reſpect the ſcandall, becauſe it was remoued by the Law: for, by obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to a lawfull Ordinance no man giues ſcandall, and if any take offence, both the cauſe and occaſion thereof is the peruerſneſſe onely of the perſon offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith well, <hi>Res bona neminem offendit, niſi malam mentem,</hi> that is, A good thing (ſuch as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience) can offend no man, but an euill minde; which muſt bee reformed by good information, and not by diſobedience, which confirmeth errour, and cauſes rebellion. <hi>Caluin</hi> in his 363. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> written to <hi>Oleuian,</hi> giues many reaſons, wherefore the comfort
<pb facs="tcp:26266:10"/>of the Sacrament ought not to be refuſed to the ſicke in time of extremitie, and declares that in his owne iudgement, he thought it expedient not to refuſe the ſame; yet he ſubioynes, <hi>Scis, frater, alium eſſe apud nos morem: fero, quia non eſt vtile contendere,</hi> that is, Yee know, Brother, wee haue another cuſtome: I beare with it, becauſe I thinke not good to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. Here <hi>Caluin</hi> preferreth the cuſtome of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua</hi> to his owne iudgement, and will leaue that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done which he thought expedient to be done, rather then by doing it, and infringing the cuſtome of the Church, to make contention. What then, ſhall wee doe ill, that good may come of it? for is it not euill to omit that which we thinke expedient to bee done, and that ought not to be refuſed, to the end good may come of it, namely, peace preſerued, and contention eſchued? To this I anſwer, The euill which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle forbids, is a thing ſimply vnlawfull in it ſelfe, and not that which in one reſpect may be expedient, and in another inexpedient: As to giue the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the ſicke is expedient for their comfort, but to giue it contrary to the order of the Church, is not expedient. In things of this nature, <hi>Ex duobus malis, minus eligendum eſt,</hi> that is, Of two euils the leaſt muſt be choſen. It is euill to refuſe the comfort of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to the ſicke, but it is worſe to giue it againſt the cuſtome of the Church, and make contention. I muſt therefore in this caſe chooſe the leaſt euill, and not giue the Sacrament, becauſe thereby the greater euill being eſchued, the leſſe ceaſſeth to bee euil, and becommeth good. It is doubtleſſe an euill thing to caſt our goods in the Sea, but it is worſe to loſe our
<pb facs="tcp:26266:10"/>liues: Here the leaſt euill is to bee choſen, for the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuing the greater, and in that reſpect it ceaſſes to be euill. Thus the rule holds in all things of this quality, when that which is euill is not vnlawfull and vnho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, but vnexpedient and vnprofitable. And ſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, <hi>Caluine</hi> for this cauſe preferres the cuſtome of Geneua, to his owne iudgement in a matter of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diencie: for it is euer more expedient to obey a Law, and keepe a lawfull Cuſtome, then to doe a thing thought more expedient, if it cannot be done, but by an open breach of the Law: becauſe thereby the Law muſt be brought in contempt, priuate opinion prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to publike authoritie, and ſo confuſion, contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Schiſme brought in; and order, peace, and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie ſhoot to the doore. To conclude, in matters of expediencie, where a Law is ſet downe, if wee make not the Law the rule of our obedience and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but our owne priuate opinions and conceits, then muſt we with the Anabaptiſts diſproue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne all ſorts of Gouernment, and liue like lawleſſe Libertines, euery man following his owne conceite; whereunto it is certaine the peruerſeneſſe of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture carryes vs, that is alwayes prone to rebellion, and therefore eaſily drawne thereto with any ſhew of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, pretext of conſcience and religion: which the Penner of this peſtilent Pamphlet conſidering, intends with Lyes, Calumnies, Falſhoods, craftie Cauillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Threatnings and Terrours of Oathes, Promiſes, and Subſcriptions, to deceiue the ſimple, ſtirre vp the Seditious, confirme the Rebellious, &amp; to beare down the Truth, his Maieſties Authority, the Power of the Church, and all that loue Order &amp; follow after peace.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:26266:11"/>
            <p>To obuiate this his ſeditious and malicious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, it was not onely expedient, but neceſſary, that this anſwere ſhould bee made, which by the grace of God, ſhall giue ſuch ſatisfaction to all good and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right hearted men, as they ſhall preferre the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, determination, and lawfull Conſtitutions of the Church, to the ſingularitie of their owne, and other priuate mens opinions; order to confuſion, peace to contention, and vnitie to ſchiſme: aſwell for the feare of God, who hath giuen power to his Church to ſet downe Lawes for order, and decencie, and hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded vs to ſubmit our ſelues thereto; as for obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the ſacred will of our moſt gracious Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne, at whoſe inſtant and earneſt deſire theſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles being found lawfull were concluded, and are now commanded to bee practiſed. When <hi>Dauid</hi> would haue gone out againſt <hi>Abſalon,</hi> hee was ſtayed by the people, who eſteemed his life more worth then a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of theirs: So ſhould euery good Chriſtian eſteeme of the loue and fauour of the Prince towards the Church. <hi>Salomon</hi> ſayes, that the wrath of a King, is the Meſſenger of Death, and like to the roring of a Lion, which a Wiſeman will pacifie, and not prouoke: and that his fauour is as the cloud of the latter raine, and as the dew vpon the graſſe. The truth of this is manifeſt in the Stories of the Church: what comfort the fauour of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great did giue to the Chriſtian Church, may be ſeene by the barbarous and cruell perſecutions of the Emperours that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>The euils, troubles, and calamities that the Church of England endured in the dayes of Queene <hi>Marie,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:26266:11"/>declared what benefit they enioyed by King <hi>Edward</hi> her Predeceſſor, and Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her Succeſſor. The beaſtly crueltie, and maſſacres vſed in France vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gouernment of the Predeceſſors of <hi>Henrie</hi> the Great, hath made manifeſt to the World, what wracke and miſery the diſcontentment, and offence of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and how great bleſſing and felicity their loue, and fauour produces to the Church of God within their Dominions. What need wee to goe further then the Scriptures for examples to this purpoſe? therein wee ſee, that as the Church decayed vnder wicked and i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous Gouernours, ſo did it euer reuiue, and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh vnder religious and godly Kings. We ſtand much vpon the offence of people, and eſteeme greatly of their fauour, wherein I will not ſay we doe euill; but ſhould wee put their fauour and offence in ballance with the fauour, and offence of him whom God hath annointed and appointed to be the nurſing Father of this Church? In whoſe loue we haue found by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and daily findes greater benefite and good for the aduancement of true Religion, then can bee expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from many thouſands of our beſt Profeſſors; let be at their hands, who in Religion like nothing well but contention, whereby they make their aduantage one way or other, as they are inclined, delighting to fiſh (as the Prouerbe is) in troubled waters.</p>
            <p>It is often obiected, that the chiefe cauſe of our yeelding at Perth to the fiue Articles, was the reſpect we had to the fauour of the Prince, and the feare of his wrath: againſt my ſelfe in particular it is falſly obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the penner of this Pamphlet, that I confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, we had neither Reaſon, Scripture, nor Antiquitie
<pb facs="tcp:26266:12"/>for them, yet to diuert the Kings wrath from the Church, yeelding was beſt. The truth is, at that time I ſpake only of kneeling at the receiuing of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and ſaid no more then I haue ſet downe in print in that Treatiſe which I publiſhed for kneeling, in the laſt words of the firſt Section of the firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and in the firſt Section of the ſecond Chapter at the beginning: this was, That neither Scripture, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, nor Reaſon doe enforce any neceſſitie either for lying, ſitting, ſtanding, or kneeling at the Sacrament; and that all theſe geſtures being indifferent, I held it moſt expedient to yeeld, and not to ſtriue with our gracious Souereigne for a matter of that nature, repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Verſe,

                  <l>Cedere maiori virtutis fama ſecunda eſt:</l>

            <p>This I ſaid at that time, and ſo yet I thinke, that to eſchue the Prince his offence, and to keep, confirme, and increaſe his loue and fauour towards the Goſpell and the Church, was a reſpect and cauſe great enough wherefore we ſhould haue yeelded vnto his Maieſties deſire in matters indifferent; againſt the lawfulneſſe whereof, nothing hath beene, or can bee obiected, which is not, and may not be eaſily anſwered. Againſt the expediencie, the feare of ſcandall was and is all that could be pretended; which if wee were peaceably diſpoſed, might haue beene, and yet may be very eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remoued: and therefore ſuch a ſeare ought neither to haue impedite our yeelding at that time, nor our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience now. We are exhorted by the holy Ghoſt to feare God, and obey the King. Where obedience to
<pb facs="tcp:26266:12"/>the Prince may ſtand with Gods feare, it ought to bee preferred by euery good Chriſtian to all other reſpects, and eſpecially by the Paſtors of the Church, who ſhould as lights goe before others both in doctrine, and example, chiefly, when peace and vnitie may bee procured and preſerued in Gods houſe by our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>For vnitie, wee ſhould bee ready to lay downe our liues, as well as for veritie, which <hi>Dionyſius</hi> Biſhop of Alexandria writing to <hi>Nouatus,</hi> affirmed, ſaying: <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuerit etiam pati omnia, ne ſcinderetur Eccleſia Dei,

This was the iudgement of that holy Father. who eſteemed it a glorious martyrdome to ſuffer for the vnitie of the Church. Contrariwiſe, the Donatiſts did glorie in this, that by their ſufferings, they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Schiſme and diuiſion, confirmed the hearts of the ſimple, and ſuperſtitious, in their errours; acquired to themſelues the renowne of Martyrs, and thereby brought vpon the Church the imputation of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb facs="tcp:26266:13"/>To whom S. <hi>Augustine</hi> anſwers, That they complained moſt vniuſtly, that they were perſecuted by the Church, becauſe the Church was more heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſecuted by them: and thereupon in the eleuenth Tractate vpon S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayes, Albeit <hi>Iſmael</hi> was caſt out of his Fathers houſe, for <hi>Iſackes</hi> ſake, yet the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle calls not <hi>Iſaack,</hi> but <hi>Iſmael,</hi> the Perſecutor. In his Booke intituled, <hi>De Vnitate Eccleſiae,</hi> againſt <hi>Petili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> the Donatiſt, he writeth thus: <hi>Grauius perſequitur filius patrem male viuendo, quam pater ſilium caſtigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do: &amp; grauius ancilla Saram perſecuta eſt per iniquam ſuperbiam, quàm eam Sara per debitam diſciplinam: &amp; grauius Dominum perſequebantur propter quos dictum eſt, Zelus domus tuae commedit me, quàm ipſe eos, cum e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum menſas euertit, &amp; eos flagello de templo expulit:</hi> that is to ſay, The ſonne perſecutes the father more grieuouſly by his wicked liuing, then the father doth the ſonne by inflicting due chaſtiſement. And <hi>Agar</hi> the Hand-maid did perſecute <hi>Sara</hi> her miſtreſſe more ſpitefully, by her vndutifull pride, then <hi>Sara</hi> did her by vſing due diſcipline. And they of whom it was ſaid, The zeale of thine houſe hath eaten mee vp, did perſecute the Lord more cruelly, then hee did them while as he ouerthrew their Tables, and droue them out of the Temple with ſcourges. And a little before in that ſame place, he affirmes, that they were the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors of themſelues by the Apoſtles words: <hi>Qui reſistit potestati, Dei ordinationi reſiſtit: qui autem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtunt, ipſi ſibi iudicium acquirunt,</hi> that is, He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God, and they that reſiſt draw puniſhment and iudgement vpon themſelues: and often repeateth this ſentence, <hi>Non poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
<pb facs="tcp:26266:13"/>fed cauſa facit martyrem,</hi> It is not the puniſhment, but the cauſe that maketh martyrdome. To reſiſt a lawfull ordinance, is euill: to ſuffer contumeliouſly for diſobedience is worſe; but by diſobedience and contumelious ſuffering to confirme People in their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and rend the bowels of the Church our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Mother, is worſt of all. Theſe things, I ſhall beſeech you Brethren to ponder; and the Lord giue vs all in meekeneſſe, and humilitie, to trie what veritie requires; and holding that faſt, to keepe the vnitie of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the band of peace.

Theſe paines are chiefly taken for thy informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that thou mayeſt know the truth and vnderſtand both the matter, and manner of proceeding in the ſaid Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly. Since that time, I heare they haue put the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet in Latine, and ſet forth other Libels full of impious and reproachfull lies againſt the principall men of our Church. Theſe I haue not ſeene, and if I had, I would not haue deigned them any anſwer. For, when leauing the matter, they fall a rayling at the perſons of men, that are their betters in all reſpects, they ſhew the weakneſſe of their cauſe, &amp; deſerue nothing of wiſemen, but contempt. This manner of doing is better replyed with the Pillorie, then otherwiſe. Wee know the eares of many are open to admit detractions, and he liues not, that is not hated by ſome, who will readily beleeue the moſt falſe things: yet, Wickedneſſe hath not ſo generally preuailed in the world, nor are we ſo vnknowne in it, as wee neede any of vs to feare their defamations. If thou, notwithſtanding, doeſt think that ſuch Libels require an anſwer, I aske thee, How
<pb facs="tcp:26266:15"/>ſhall it be done? I know no way my ſelfe, but eyther to vſe Apologies or recriminations. And this laſt were not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficile to doe: for though the Writer goeth nameleſſe, the Faction to whoſe pleaſure he writes is knowne, and they that ſport themſelues with ſuch libels, ſending them from hand to hand, as matters of ſome worth. Their perſons we could eaſily pay home, and repone true things vnto them in ſtead of forged, telling them no other matters, then haue beene tried, confeſſed, and publiquely acknowledged by thoſe that are hotteſt in this buſineſſe, of themſelues: but theſe are the weapons of the vulgar, which we diſdain to vſe, <hi>&amp; vltio haec, Chriſtiano homini maxime indeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra.</hi> As for Apologies, the Wiſe man ſaith, That they leaue ſuſpitions in the Readers mind, <hi>&amp; plures Sermones pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocant, &amp; plurium:</hi> The beſt Apologie againſt calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, is, <hi>conuitiatores factis refellere.

He that iudges is the Lord, who will lighten things that are hidden in darkeneſſe, and make the counſells of the hearts mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest: And then ſhall euerie man haue praiſe of God.

This propoſition was made by his Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie himſelfe in the Chappell of the Caſtle, where then his Maieſtie remained. Vpon the hearing whereof, humble peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made by the Biſhops and Miniſters there aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, that they ſhould bee permitted to conferre amongſt themſelues, vpon the ſaid propoſition, before they gaue any anſwer. Which being graunted, they went, and met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:26266:23"/>in the Seſſion houſe of the Paroch Church, where after mature deliberation, it was concluded, they ſhould put vp one common Supplication, to his Maieſtie for libertie of a generall Aſſembly, to aduiſe and take concluſion in theſe poynts. It being ſignified vnto them at the ſame time by the Archbiſhop of S. <hi>Andrewes,</hi> that his Maieſty would take this for a ſhift, and not content with the Supplication, vnleſſe aſſurance were giuen, that the ſame Articles, ſhould be yeelded vnto, in the Aſſembly; Anſwer was made by the whole number, That howſoeuer, they could not preiudge themſelues of their free voyces in an Aſſembly, by graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſaid Articles before-hand, conſidering they were matters in themſelues lawfull, and of a nature indifferent; as they could not thinke but the whole Church would bee readie to giue his Maieſtie ſatisfaction therein, ſo for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, they would doe what lay in them for paſſing the ſame. And this they all deſired the ſaid Archbiſhop in their names to anſwer. But hee denying to promiſe any thing in the behalfe of the Miniſters, in regard of the ſeditious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, they had, againſt their promiſe, at leaſt a number of them peoned to be giuen in the next Parliament, Maiſter <hi>Patricke Galloway</hi> was by them deſired to make the ſaid an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, and concurre with the Biſhops in the foreſaid ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation for a generall Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>Thus, all returning to the ſaide Chappell, petition was made in humble forme to his Maieſtie by the Archbiſhop in the name of the whole, That they might be permitted to meete in an Aſſembly, where the ſaid Articles ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the anſwer, which was fit. His Maieſtie replying, that hee could not ſuffer theſe Articles, which hee counted both lawfull and profitable for the Church, to bee caſt in the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration of an Aſſembly, where by reaſon of the multitude, matters went often doubtfully, except he had aſſurance, the ſame ſhould be yeelded vnto; anſwer was made, That how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they could not that were preſent, take on them to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere for the whole Church, yet becauſe they did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue

This was promiſed by the Archbiſhop of Saint-<hi>Andrewes</hi> in name of all the Biſhops, and by Maſter <hi>Patrick-Galloway</hi> in name of the Miniſters, as was afore-agreed.</p>
            <p>Hereupon his Maieſtie was pleaſed to condeſcend vpon the meeting of an Aſſembly at Saint-<hi>Andrewes,</hi> in the moneth of <hi>Nonember</hi> following, where the ſaid Articles, being reaſoned vpon at length, it was found by vniuerſall conſent, That they contayned in them nothing vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but in reſpect the ſuddaine receiuing of them might giue offence to the weaker Profeſſors, and encouragement to the enemies of Religion, it was thought meete to differ the taking of any concluſion, ſpecially about the keeping of the Feſtiuall dayes, and kneeling at the Communion, vnto another Aſſembly; And all the Miniſters commanded, like as they who were preſent for themſelues promiſed, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their people and Congregations, aſwell of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of the things deſired, as of the neceſſitie they had to receiue the ſame, becauſe of his Maieſties reſolution ſo to haue it; and by this meanes all offence being remoued, in the next Aſſembly matters might take an end with vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme conſent; in the meane time, leſt his Maieſtie ſhould offend with this delay, his Maieſties Commiſſioners, and the Biſhops were earneſtly entreated by the ſaid Aſſembly to ſignifie the true reaſons of the preſent co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuation, &amp; beſeech the ſame to bee well interpreted, ſeeing no denyall of the Articles was intended, but a care on their parts to remoue all ſcruple and offence from amongſt the people.</p>
            <p>This aduertizement being made, his Maieſtie tooke the ſame ſo hardly, as forth-with he gaue commandement to the Biſhops to obſerue the dayes of Chriſtmaſſe, Paſſion, Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, &amp;c. And to cauſe all the Miniſters of their Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to obſerue the like, as alſo to alter the geſture of ſitting
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:26266:24"/>at the holy Communion, into that of kneeling, which the Article required. And to ſequeſtrate the ſtipends of ſo many as ſhould be found diſobedient.</p>
            <p>It grieued all the honeſt and true-hearted Miniſters to ſee his Maieſty ſo offended, and many repented the delay made in the laſt Aſſembly: and becauſe there was one meane only left to giue ſatisfaction, to wit, That a new Aſſembly might be gathered to put end to the ſame; the Archbiſhop of Saint <hi>Andrewes</hi> was entreated to intercede with his Maieſty for a mitigation of the rigour intended againſt the Miniſters, and liberty for a new Aſſembly, to finiſh that which remayned to be perfected. To this effect he diſpatched his Seruant vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Court with haſte, writing in ſuch humble ſort as became, and for the purpoſe aboue-ſaid; but receiued this Anſwere, That touching another Aſſembly his Maieſty would neuer condeſcend vnto the ſame, except better aſſurance were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of their reaſonable conforming; therefore commanded him and the reſt of the Biſhops in their ſeuerall Synods, to vrge the receiuing of the ſaid Articles, and as they ſhould find them inclining, to aduertiſe; and for the ſequeſtration of ſtipends, his Maieſty would be pleaſed to remit that rigor for the preſent, ſo as the Biſhops by themſelues in their Sees, with ſo many others as they could perſwade, ſhould put in practice the ſaid Articles according to the Letter, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly directed vuto them.</p>
            <p>This Anſwere being communicated vnto the Miniſters of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and a great many others, that were attending at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> for the ſetling of their Churches according to the Commiſſion giuen in Parliament, they all aduiſed the Biſhops to giue obedience in their own perſons, and at their Synods, to labour the Miniſters of their bounds in the beſt ſort they could, to condeſcend vnto the Articles proponed.</p>
            <p>The Biſhops reſoluing to giue obedience, for his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties better ſatisfaction, and freeing the Miniſters of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued wrath, agreed, after their Synods were ended, to meet at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in <hi>May</hi> next; and as they ſhould find by
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:26266:24"/>report of the Miniſters inclination to yeeld to the ſaid Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, to follow their Supplication about a new Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>According to which agreement, they hauing met at <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> and vnderſtood that in the Synods kept in the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril</hi> before, the Miniſters were diſpoſed to glue obedience and ſatisfaction to his Maieſtie: they by their Letters hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly entreated his Maieſties Licence, for the holding of an new Aſſembly, and obtayned the ſame; which they ſignified by their Letters to the Moderators of their ſeuerall exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the Countrey, willing them to elect and chooſe the moſt wiſe, learned and peaceable Miniſters in their bounds, to be Commiſſionaries at the ſaid Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>But contrary to this aduice and direction, certaine facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and vnruly Miniſters, that haue loued alwayes to keepe ſtirres in the Church, and placed their glory in the oppoſing of his Maieſties lawfull deſires, vſed all the diligence they could, where they had credit, to purchaſe Commiſſion to themſelues, and others that fauoured their opinions, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbing the ſaid Aſſembly; and came thither at the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in great numbers, &amp; certaine hopes to haue carryed matters otherwiſe then was inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded; howbeit to little effect, as the ſucceſſe of the ſaid meeting manifeſted. Vpon theſe occaſions the meeting was brought on; &amp; not abruptly by a Proclamation, being made 20 daies before, as the Libeller would haue it to appear. The ſaid Proclamation being made only to take away all excuſe from ſuch as might pretend ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the day. Which being come, according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of a long time obſerued, the firſt meeting was begun with prayer &amp; faſting, whereof the Libeller grants that inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was made in the Church of <hi>Perth</hi> the Sonday prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaines that the faſt was little regarded, &amp; it may be by himſelf, &amp; others of that Sect, whoſe diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were only to make ſtrife: but he cannot deny, that in the firſt exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the morning, made by the Biſhop of <hi>Abirdene,</hi> exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was giuen to all that were preſent, both to ſanctifie themſelues, &amp; by prayer to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend the ſucceſſe of the affairs vnto God his bleſſing. The ſame was repeated in the ſecond
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:26266:25"/>exerciſe made by the Archbiſhop of Saint-<hi>Andrewes,</hi> and nothing omitted on our parts, that was required to bring men to a due regard thereof. But the Libeller excepts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſecond Sermon. Firſt, that although the Text was pertinent, the Preacher ranne quickly from it: Next that in his Diſcourſe of Ceremonies, &amp; the fiue Articles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned, his beſt Arguments were teſtimonies cited out of <hi>Caluine, Martyr</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> all peruerted. How the firſt can bee made good, I ſee not, ſeeing if the Text was pertinent, as he confeſſed, to the time and matters there to bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, it is as cleere, that in all his Diſcourſe, hee did ſo ſtrictly keep himſelf to the purpoſe, as there was not ſo much as one digreſſion made from it. And whether hee brought no Arguments for proofe, or peruerted the teſtimonies of theſe learned men: Let the Reader iudge, by the Sermon it ſelfe, which wee haue made here to bee inſerted word for word, as the ſame was then deliuered.</p>

Of the indifferency of theſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, I thinke there is little or no queſtion amongſt vs: The conueniencie of them for our Church is doubted of by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but not without cauſe; They are new and vncouth, ſuch things as we haue not beene accuſtomed with; and nouati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in a Church, euen in the ſmalleſt things are dangerous, <hi>Etiam quae vtilitate adiuuant, nouitate perturbant.</hi>

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:26266:26"/>yeelding, or diſobeying him, whom for my ſelfe, I hold it Religion, to offend; I muſt tell you, that the euill of noua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, eſpecially in matters of Rite &amp; Ceremonie, is nothing ſo great as the euill of diſobedience. That which is new this day, with a little vſe, will become familiar and old: yee know the prouerbe, A wonder laſts but nine nights in a Towne. But how farre diſobedience may goe, what euills it may produce, God knowes. As the Apoſtle ſpeakes here of Contention, ſo I ſay of Diſobedience, we haue no ſuch cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, nor the Churches of God. We leaue that to Papiſts and Anabaptiſts, that carry no regard to authoritie: Our Religion teaches vs to obey our Superiours, in all things, that are not contrarie to the Word of God. So our Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſpeakes, which is printed in the beginning of your Pſalme bookes,
<note place="margin">Pſal. Booke, <hi>pag.</hi> 6.</note> So haue wee taught the people in former times, and God forbid, wee ſhould now come in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie.</p>
                        <p>Our caſe, as I thinke, at this time, is not farre different from that of the Corinthians, at the writing of this Epiſtle: The queſtion was amongſt them, of the behauiour of men, and women in holy Aſſemblies. What was moſt decent and beſeeming, men to be vncouered, women to haue their heads couered, or by the contrarie. Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> after that hee had ſhewed his owne minde in the matter, and giuen ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for it, as hee doth in the Verſes preceding, concludes now with this proteſtation: <hi>If any man ſeeme to bee conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, wee haue no ſuch custome, neither the Churches of God.</hi> As though hee would ſay, I haue ſaid ſo much as may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent calme and moderate ſpirits; as for contentious men, I trouble not my ſelfe with them; They will ſtill be diſputing, and ſay what yee will, they ſhall ſtill finde a reply, for they are

                           </gap>, louers of Victorie, not of Veritie; men that ſeeketh not the Churches weale, but their owne wills, and make it their credit to bee alwayes ſtirring: that is not my cuſtome, ſaith the Apoſtle (he might ſpeake it well, for hee neuer cared for himſelfe, or how he was counted of, ſo as he
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:26266:26"/>might be profitable to the Church, and an inſtrument of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſoules.) And as it is not my cuſtome, no more is it the cuſtome of the Churches of God; for they fauour not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, but follow the things which concerne peace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with one may edifie, and make better another.</p>
                        <p>Some of the Interpreters refer theſe words to the queſtion in hand, and thinke that the Apoſtle is here oppoſing the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the Churches, to theſe that contended for men co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering their heads in publike meetings: but the better ſort take this to bee ſpoken againſt the ſtudie of contention, and thinke the Apoſtle his meaning here, is onely to ſhew, that it is not his faſhion, nor the faſhion of the Churches of God, to bee contentious for matters of ſuch indifferency as thoſe were of. This is <hi>Caluines</hi> interpretation amongſt others, for he writing vpon this place, after he had ſaid, that contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a Church, is of all euills the moſt pernicious, addes by way of admonition theſe words: <hi>Diligenter notemus locum istum, ne abripi nos ſuper vacuis diſputationibus ſinamus:</hi> Let vs carefully obſerue this place, ſaith hee, that wee ſuffer not our ſelues to bee carryed away with vnneceſſary diſputings. Now, theſe are vnneceſſary diſputings, which are made, <hi>De rebus non magnis,</hi> of matters of light moment, <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>el de rebus non ambiguis,</hi> that is, of matters in themſelues cleare and euident. <hi>Atqui tales ſunt importuni quidam diſputatores, qui artis eſſe putant, omnia in dubium vocare:</hi> Some there are that can finde probabilities againſt the cleareſt Truth, and are ſtill diſputing about the lighteſt matters: Such are very troublers, and dangerous heads in a Church, of whom wee ſhould be wary.</p>
                        <p>Brethren, to contend is not a fault, if ſo it bee, for a weightie matter; but to bee contentious in a light buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, this is faultie, and reprooued here by the Apoſtle. Wee ought to contend alwayes for the Faith, and that earneſtly, as Saint <hi>Iude</hi> teacheth,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Iude</hi> 3.</note> not yeelding to the Aduerſarie, in the ſubſtance of Religion, one jot: There ſhould our courage and ſpirituall zeale kindle it ſelfe;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:26266:27"/>but for matters of circumſtance and ceremonie, to make buſineſſe, and as much adoe, as if ſome mayne point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion were queſtioned, it is to iniurie the Truth of God. By this meanes, men are brought to miſſe-regard all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and wee that are the Preachers of the Word, come to bee deſpiſed.</p>
                        <p>In the meane time it is not to be denyed, but they are ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, which for the inconuenience they bring, ought to be reſiſted; and if wee bee preſſed with ſuch, it is our part to expone our diſlike of them in modeſtie, and by the beſt, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt meanes we can vſe, to decline theſe which wee eſteeme to bee hurtfull: Not (as our follies haue beene great in this kinde) to runne before the time, and ſeeke to amend mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by declinators and proteſtations, whereby wee haue profited nothing; onely wee haue incenſed authoritie, and haſtened vpon our ſelues the ſame things which wee labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to eſchue. Well, theſe things cannot bee made vndone, yet, they ſhould make vs wiſe for afterwards. And now, Brethren, becauſe the reſolution we take at this time touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Articles propounded, will giue to the world a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie what manner of men wee are, whether ſuch as rule their proceedings by iudgement, or are carried head-ſtrong with conceits and opinions; that wee bee nor miſſe-led by ignorance (for that is the fault of many amongſt vs, wee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire not of matters, nor take paynes to vnderſtand what hath beene the iudgement of the moſt wiſe and learned, but follow vpon truſt, the opinions we haue beene bred with, and of ſuch as we affect) to helpe this, I ſay, I will, with your patience, ſpend ſome time in the queſtion of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, ſee what warrant they haue, and how they ſhould bee appointed: then from the generall deſcend to ſpeake of our particulars, touching which I ſhall freely deliuer my owne minde, and ſo conclude.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, then concerning Ceremonies, howſoeuer ſome haue imagined them to bee ſuperfluities, which might well bee ſpared, and that the Church of Rome hath made the very
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:26266:27"/>name of them hatefull, aſwell becauſe of the multitude of them, wherewith ſhe oppreſſed Chriſtians, as for the ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous choice ſhe made of moſt of them: are ſuch things, as without which no publike action either Ciuill, or Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtique can be rightly performed.</p>
                        <p>To this purpoſe a Politike Writer, hath ſaid well, That as the fleſh couereth the hollow deformity of the bones, and beautifieth the bodie with naturall graces, ſo Ceremonies (ſuch ſpecially, as ancient cuſtome hath made reuerend) co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the nakedneſſe of publike actions, and diſtinguiſh them from priuate buſineſſe, that otherwiſe ſhould not bee ſo well knowne. The neglect of this in any State, breedes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and with confuſion the ruine, and aboliſhment of the State it ſelfe; whereof the examples were eaſie to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the Romane Republike, and others, if that were our ſubiect. But wee are ſpeaking of Church-Ceremonies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which no man will deny this generall truth: That in euery publike dutie, which God craues at our hands, there is beſides the matter and forme wherein the ſubſtance of the dutie conſiſts, a certaine externall forme required, to the decent adminiſtration of the ſame. As for example: God hath commanded his Word to bee preached, and the holy Sacraments to be miniſtred, Baptiſme by the Element of Water, and in a preſcript forme of words, ſuch as you know wee vſe; and the Sacrament of his bleſſed Body and Bloud, in the Elements of Bread and Wine, with certaine myſticall words added thereunto: heere is the dutie to bee done, and the ſubſtance of it; yet for the miniſtration of the ſame in a due and decent manner, there is place, time, and other circumſtances moe required. The ſubſtance of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God hath giuen vs in the Word, from which we may not goe; but for theſe things that belong to the outward admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, Eccleſiaſticall wiſedome hath to define what is conuenient, what not; <hi>Ne<expan>

                        <p>This, as one ſpeakes well, is that great Eccleſiaſticall Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, by which all other Canons muſt bee ſquared; this is the true Touch-ſtone of trying Ceremonies, and the ballance wherein all Church Orders muſt be weighed. The Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Church muſt be decent and comely, without va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, without all meretricious brauerie, not ſuperfluous, but ſeruing to edification. They muſt alſo be done to God; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and not be idolatrous or ſuperſtitious; Generally in the Church, all things muſt be done in order, and no confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be either of perſons or proceedings, for order hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the Throne of the Almightie. This fabricke of the World that wee ſee, is vpholden by it, States, and Kingdomes are maintayned by it, and without it nothing can flouriſh or proſper. And if Order ſhould haue place in all things, ſure the Church of God, ſhould not be without Order; for our God, whom wee ſerue, is the God of Order, and not of Confuſion, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes.</p>

And certainly, there is no other way to keepe away differences for matters of Rites and Ceremonies, but this, That euery man keepe the cuſtome of the Church wherein
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:26266:29"/>he liues, and obſerue that which is determined by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours thereof. For in things indifferent wee muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes eſteeme that to bee beſt, and moſt ſeemely, which ſeemes ſo in the eye of publike authoritie. Neither is it for priuate men to controll publike iudgement: as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make publike Conſtitutions, ſo they may not controll nor diſobey them being once made. Indeed authoritie ought to looke carefully vnto this, that it preſcribe nothing but rightly; appoint no Rites nor Orders in the Church, but ſuch as may ſet forward Godlineſſe and Pietie: yet put the caſe, that ſome be otherwiſe eſtabliſhed, they muſt be obeyed by ſuch as are members of that Church, as long as they haue the force of a Conſtitution, and are not corrected by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie that made them. Except this be, there can bee no order, and all muſt be filled with ſtrife and contention. But thou wilt ſay, My conſcience ſuffers mee not to obey, for I am perſwaded, that ſuch things are not right, nor well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. I anſwere thee, in matters of this nature and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, the ſentence of thy Superiours ought to direct thee, and that is a ſufficient ground to thy conſcience for obeying. But may not Superiours erre? May not Councels decree that which is wrong?

And there is a fift Article that requires our accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med manner of ſitting at the Communion, to be changed in a more religious and reuerend geſture of kneeling: ye ſhall not expect to heare all that may be ſaid, or is at this time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient concerning theſe, neither the time, nor the ſtrength of any one man, I think, will ſuffice to ſay all without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. I know I ſpeake to men of vnderſtanding, and my intent is to ſay no more of them, then may ſerue to iuſtifie the aduiſe which I minde with Gods helpe to giue vnto you.</p>
                        <p>I begin with the Communion to the Sicke, becauſe this Article paſſed in the late Aſſembly, with ſome limitations which his Maieſty diſliked. The mind that is offended hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interprets any thing well, ſo fared it in this matter. The delay of our anſwere to the reſt of the Articles, mooued his Maieſtie to call our grant of this Article ſcornfull and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous. I was bold in a priuate Letter to ſhew there was a miſtaking, and iuſtifie that which was done; neither ſhould I ſpeake any more of it, but that it hath beene complayned, that ſome of our Miniſterie, beeing earneſtly entreated by
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:26266:30"/>certaine ſicke perſons, for the comfort of that Sacrament, ſince that time haue deuyed the ſame. To iuſtifie therefore that which then was inacted, I ſay ſhortly, that by our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling wee are directly bound to miniſter vnto men in the laſt houre all the helpes and comforts wee poſſibly can: the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall terrours of death, and fearefull doubts of conſcience which at that time commonly perplexe men, require this at our hands; therefore Viſitation of the ſicke is earneſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to Miniſters in their admiſſion, that they bee readie to attend the ſicke perſon, and as his eſtate craues, miniſter comfort vnto him, by preaching the promiſes of grace and mercie to all penitent ſinners. Why this Sacrament, that is the ſeale of Gods promiſes, and a ſpeciall meane of binding vp our Communion with Chriſt, ſhould bee denyed to ſuch as deſire the ſame in that time, there can be no reaſon.</p>
                        <p>Howbeit ſaluation depends not vpon the Sacrament, and that they vſe it ſuperſtitiouſly that giues it for a <hi>viaticum</hi> to the dying, the end of a man cannot but be the more comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and his death accompanyed with the greater content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and tranquilitie of minde, when his deſire is ſatisfied in this point. For this is to bee conſidered, that it is not to all that die, nor to all that are ſicke, but to ſuch onely whoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery is deſperate, and vrgently deſire the comfort of this Sacrament, that the ſame is appointed to bee miniſtred. Of which purpoſe <hi>Caluin</hi> deliuers his opinion in his 52. Epiſtle, in theſe words: <hi>De Coenae administratione conſeo, libenter admittendum eſſe hunc morem, vt apud aegrotos celebretur com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munio, quum ita res &amp; opportunitas feret; Nec magnopere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnandum eſſe, quin maleficis detur, qui plectendi ſunt, ſi qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem postulent, &amp; ad receptionem ſatis comparatos eſſe appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reat: hac tamen lege, vt ſit vnà communio, hoc est, vt panis in coetu aliquo fidelium frangatur.</hi> And in his 361. Epiſtle, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering ſome one that had moued him in this matter, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnes on this manner: <hi>Cur coenam aegrotis negandam eſſe non arbitror, multae &amp; graues cauſae me impellunt,</hi> as you may ſee in the place. <hi>Bucer, Bullinger,</hi> and <hi>Zepperus</hi> are of the ſame
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:26266:31"/>iudgement; and the laſt of theſe three, putting the caſe, that none is by this ſicke man diſpoſed to communicate, ſayes, <hi>Quod ne ſic quidem priuandus est communione aegrotus.</hi> You may ſee his reaſons in the twelft Chapter of his firſt Booke, <hi>De Politia Eccleſiaſtica.</hi> Our owne Church hath practiſed the ſame in former times, as was qualified in diuers particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars at the laſt Aſſembly. So where the reformed Churches haue approued it, and wee our ſelues by our owne practice, now to ſtand againſt it, when, by a ſpeciall Canon it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to bee done, cannot but bee thought obſtinate diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>
                        <p>I come to the Article of Baptiſme: This craues that in the caſe of neceſſitie, when a child without hazard may not bee brought out of doores, it bee lawfull to the Miniſter to baptiſe in a priuate houſe. It was not long ſince, a cuſtome amongſt vs, that no Miniſter would baptiſe, except vpon the ordinarie day of teaching; this ſame being complayned of in the Aſſembly that was kept at Holy Rood-houſe, in the yeare 1602. an Ordinance was made, that whenſoeuer a Parent ſhould require baptiſme to his child, the Miniſter ſhould not deny it, without delaying to the ordinarie day of preaching. The queſtion was then of the Time, now it is of the Place: Whereabout, this you all know, that in the inſtitution of Baptiſme, the Lord Ieſus hath not tyed vs to any place, but his command binds all men to bee baptized: And wee, that are Miniſters, by our calling are obliged to baptiſe, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer wee doe not thinke Baptiſme abſolutely neceſſary vnto ſaluation, and the child that wants it vpon a neceſſitie ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitable, nothing preiudiced that way; yet if the occaſion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, there is no doubt, but the Miniſter hath a neceſſitie ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon him to baptize, although time, place, and other circumſtances required for the due and ſolemne adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be not concurring. But this, yee will ſay, foſters the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh opinion of the neceſſitie of Baptiſme. Let <hi>Bucer</hi> anſwer it, To with-hold Baptiſme for want of the due ſolemnities, ſayes hee, opens a doore to the Deuill, to bring in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:26266:31"/>of Chriſts Ordinance, and our whole redemption by him: We haue a Commandement to baptize, and this to vs is a neceſſary duety which we may not leaue vndone: As for inconueniences, we muſt meet them as wiſely, as we may, by doctrine and diligent catechizing, but in no ſort neglect the Commandement that is giuen. Yee ſhall haue <hi>Caluin</hi> his iudgement alſo in this matter; being asked: <hi>Vbinam baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus recte adminiſtrari poſſit?</hi> He anſwers, <hi>Fas non eſt admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrare baptiſmum, niſi in coetu fidelium, non quidem vt templum requiratur, ſed vt vbiuis, numerus aliquis fidelium conueniat, qui Eccleſiae corpus efficiat.</hi> Yee haue this in his 185. Epiſtle. And thus much for Baptiſme.</p>
                        <p>The third Article is of Confirmation, to be giuen to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, when they are come to the yeares of diſcretion, and that is one of the moſt ancient cuſtomes of the Chriſtian Church, from the dayes of the Apoſtles it hath continued, and with them it began. Neither is there any thing more profitable, for it helps children to bee ſeaſoned with the principles of true Religion, layes a good foundation for the better direction of their whole life, preſerues the ſeede of the Church ſound, makes children more diligent to learne, and Paſtors, and Parents more carefull to inſtruct them. The neglect of this dutie hath done much harme in the Church, and the reſtitution of that good cuſtome, which <hi>Caluin</hi> in the fourth Booke of his Inſtitutions earneſtly wiſhes, could not but bring with it an exceeding great benefit. It was in ſubſtance agreed vnto in the Aſſembly at Abirdene; but two things his Maieſtie found deficient in the Act: One that there was no mention of laying on of hands vpon the child confirmed: Another was, that the performance of it was not reſtricted to the Biſhops care. And for this laſt, it is cleare by all Antiquitie, that the power of Confirming appertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned euer to Biſhops; Not, that Confirmation is a Sacrament of greater dignitie then Baptiſme, as the Papiſts teach (theſe were the thoughts of ignorance:) but as S. <hi>Hierome</hi> ſpeakes, The Church thought fit, that ſeeing Baptiſme is giuen by
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:26266:32"/>Presbyters, leſt children ſhould be ignorant of the ſpirituall ſuperioritie of Biſhops ouer them, they ſhould attend the receiuing of Confirmation by their hands; ſo, this was done for the honour of Prelacy, as he ſpeakes. Now, if any man will enuy this honour to Biſhops, it is a ſilly and poore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy: for it encreaſes their charge and burthen; and if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of their dutie make them not carefull of it, in this profane and irreligious age, the honor or credit it can bring them, will neuer worke it: Touching impoſition of hands, let Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> tell vs what it meanes: Hee in his fift Booke, <hi>De Baptiſmo contra Donatiſtas, cap.</hi> 23. ſayes, <hi>Quid eſt manuum impoſitio, niſi oratio ſuper hominem?</hi> that is to ſay, What is impoſition of hands, but a prayer vpon the man, that hands are laid vpon? In all perſonall benedictions, from the very beginning of the world, it hath beene vſed: Parents doe yet confer their bleſſing in this manner to their children, and when ſpirituall bleſſings are giuen, there can bee no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to doe it with the like ceremonie. But I heare that ſome cannot abide to heare the word of <hi>Confirmation;</hi> the thing it ſelfe gladly they admit, but they would haue exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or ſome the like word put for it: Not onely the abuſe, but the very name of the thing abuſed, (ſo tender are the hearts of ſome men) muſt be put away. For this ſhortly, I ſay, that the Scriptures neuer taught vs to place Religion in wordes. Saint <hi>Luke</hi> made no ſcruple, ſpeaking of a ſtreet in Athens, to call it the ſtreet of <hi>Mars:</hi> And the ſhip that <hi>Paul</hi> ſayled in, he names by <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> though both theſe were the Idols of Pagans. If names were to be ſtood vpon, we ſhould put our ſelues to great buſineſſe, &amp; it behoueth to change the names of our Moneths, and Dayes, which ſome haue preſſed vnto, but wiſe men know this to be folly. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the word of <hi>Confirmation</hi> was vſed in the Church long before Popery was hatched, as is manifeſt by Saint <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> Saint <hi>Augustine, Tertullian, Euſebius,</hi> and others. And thus much of Confirmation.</p>

                        <p>The <hi>Feſtiuities,</hi> which are the next, are impugned by this Argument amongſt others, That hereby wee conforme our ſelues to Papiſts in the keeping of holy dayes: But had this Argument beene of any force, would the reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches haue agreed ſo vniformely in the obſeruation of them? All of them, ſo farre as I know, keepe holy the dayes of Chriſts Natiuitie, Paſſion, Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion, with the Deſcent of the holy Ghoſt. The Churches of Bohemie, Vngarie, Polonia, Denmarke, Saxonie, and high Germany: The Heluetian Churches, the Belgique, and thoſe of the low Countreyes; The French, Engliſh, and Geneua it ſelfe, in the beginning of reformation, obſerued them all.

                        <p>Of the laſt Article, which requires kneeling, as the moſt reuerend geſture in partaking the holy Sacrament of the Communion, I haue neede to ſay much, ſeeing great ſtirres are made for this, and as I eſteeme without any cauſe. The Apoſtle when he profeſſes to deliuer vnto vs that which hee receyued of the Lord, ſpeakes not, either of ſitting, or knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or ſtanding; by which it is cuident, That <hi>ſitus, vel poſitus corporis in coena,</hi> as <hi>Zepperus</hi> ſpeakes, is not of the eſſence of the Sacrament, but to be numbered amongſt theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which the Church may alter, and change at their pleaſure. Where it is ſaid, that wee ought to conforme our ſelues to Chriſts action, yee know it is anſwered, That if ſo were, it behoued vs to lye along about the Table; to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with men, and not with women: And in the Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after ſupper, receiue this Sacrament, which things were ridiculous to affirme. <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> an excellent witneſſe of Gods truth, <hi>In claſſe ſecunda Locorum communium Cap.</hi> 4. ſpeakes otherwiſe: <hi>Nihil intereſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſi coenae Dominicae ſacramentum ſtantes, aut ſedentes, aut genibus flexis percipia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, modò inſtitutum Domini conſeruetur, &amp; occaſio ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus

Is there any amongſt vs, ſaith he, who euer denyed, that we ought to adore the fleſh of Ieſus Chriſt? Who euer doubted, that wee ought to adore him in the Euchariſt? But he that adores Ieſus Chriſt in the Euchariſt, does not for all that, adore that which the Prieſt holds in his hand, but he adores Ieſus Chriſt who is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.

                        <p>Thus I haue ſhewed you the iudgement of the beſt Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches touching theſe Articles: Thereby you haue ſeene that there is nothing impious or vnlawfull in them: they who ſhew a diſlike of ſome of them in the laſt Aſſembly, could not ſay other. And ſurely, if it cannot bee ſhewed, that they are repugnant to the written Word, I ſee not with what conſcience wee can refuſe them, being vrged as they are, by our Souereigne Lord and King: A King who is not a ſtranger to Diuinitie, but hath ſuch acquaintance with it, as Rome neuer found in the confeſſions of all men a more potent Aduerſary: a King neither ſuperſtitious, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable that way, but one that ſeekes to haue God righlty and truly worſhipped by all his Subiects. His Perſon, were he not our Souereigne, giues them ſufficient authoritie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recommended by him; for hee knowes the nature of things and the conſequences of them, what is fit for a Church to haue, and what not, better then we doe all.</p>
                        <p>But I heare ſome anſwere, That were it knowne, theſe things proceeded of himſelfe, they would make the leſſe queſtion of them: but they are thought to come by the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of ſome of the Engliſh Church, or them of our ſelues at home. For the firſt, I will but remember you of his Maieſties owne Declaration in the Chappell of Saint-<hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes,</hi> where with a great atteſtation more then needed from a Prince to his Subiects, Hee declared that neither the deſire he had for conforming his Churches, nor the ſoliciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any perſon, did ſet him on this worke, but his zeale for God, and a certaine knowledge that hee could not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere it in that great Day, if hee ſhould neglect this dutie. His Maieſties Letter to the laſt Aſſembly beares ſo much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Now any of vs would take it euill, not to be beleeued af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our ſolemne atteſtations: and I truſt in all your confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, his Maieſtie deſerues ſome greater reſpect. As to that which is ſuppoſed of vs at home, my ſelfe chiefly, if I ſhall beleeue the rumours that are going, I will borrow that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table man his ſpeech in a caſe not vnlike, <hi>Mihi hactenus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pemodum

Neither did I heare after that time of them any thing, while that Proteſtation was formed to bee preſented to the States of Parliament: at what time, his Maieſtie taking the aduantage of their miſ-behauiour, who penned the Proteſtation and proudly ſtood to the ſame, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to haue theſe Articles admitted in our Church, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all my care was to ſaue the Church her authoritie, and labour that they might be referred to an Aſſembly; which was obtayned vpon promiſe, that his Maieſty ſhould receiue ſatisfaction, and the promiſe was not made by mee alone, but ratified by your ſelues, as you remember at Saint-<hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes.</hi> In the Aſſembly that followed, howſoeuer my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice took no place, I ioyned after the diſſoluing therof with my Lords the Biſhops, to excuſe the delay that was made at the time: but our Letter being euill accepted, and another returning full of anger and indignation, which diuerſe of your ſelues haue ſeene, I trauelled at the Miniſters their ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ſolicitation, by all the wayes I could, to diuert the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, which before this time moſt certainly yee would haue felt. And all that hath proceeded ſince ye know. So as I ſpake before, I would, if it had beene in my power, moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:26266:35"/>haue declined the receiuing of theſe Articles. Not, that I did eſteeme them either vnlawfull or inconuenient, for I am ſo farre perſwaded of the contrary, as I can bee of any thing; but I foreſaw the contradiction which would bee made, and the buſineſſe we ſhould fall into. Therefore, let no man deceiue himſelfe; theſe things proceede from his Maieſtie, and are his owne motions, not any others.</p>
                        <p>I heare others ſay, they could agree with the Articles, but that they take them to be introductions of the reſt of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Ceremonies, wherewith they cannot away. To this I anſwer, That the ready way to haue the reſt impoſed, is to offend his Maieſtie by our reſiſting; and the way to be freed of them, is to approue our ſelues in the obedience of theſe. Thereby both yee and wee ſhall finde a more gracious hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in any thing that concerneth the Church. Call to mind the courſes of former times, and tell me if our oppoſitions did euer gayne vs any thing? If experience will not make vs wiſe, what can?</p>
                        <p>But this, others ſay, is hard to bee done: becauſe our preaching and practice haue both beene to the contrarie, and a yeelding now cannot but ſtayne our credits. I will not reply, that it is no credit to be conſtant in euill, nor any diſcredit to change for the better; for this would ſound harſhly in the eares of many: onely I ſhall wiſh thoſe who ſtand ſo much for their credit, to lay before themſelues Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> example, who became all to all, that hee might ſaue ſome. Hee had preached againſt Circumciſion; againſt the keeping of the lewiſh Sabbaths, their new Moones, and other Rites: he had called them yokes, burthens, importent, and beggarly rudiments; and reproued Saint <hi>Peter</hi> for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Gentiles conforme to the Iewes in theſe things; yet after all this he circumciſed <hi>Timothy,</hi> and practiſed himſelfe diuers of their Ceremonies. The reaſon was, that he ſaw no other way to redeeme the libertie of his Miniſterie, further the Goſpell, and increaſe the Churches: In this hee placed his credit, and ſo hee did ſpeed in that; hee ſtood not much
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:26266:36"/>what men reported of him. If the zeale of God leade vs, and the loue of his Church, wee will not looke ſo much to our ſelues and to our owne reputation, as to the furthering of the worke of the Goſpell.</p>
                        <p>It will be replyed, I know, that not for themſelues, but for the offence of the people, they feare to admit theſe things. For hauing preached againſt holy dayes, and the reſt, and hauing defended the Conſtitutions of the Church, which now muſt be altered, there cannot but great offence enſue. I can make no other anſwer to this, then ſay, That, I truſt, none of our Preachers haue ſtood againſt the keeping of dayes ſimply; but againſt the ſuperſtitious keeping of them as Papiſts doe, and againſt the laſciuiouſneſſe of people, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning thoſe dayes by vnlawfull exerciſes: Nor haue wee taught at any time, <hi>ſitting</hi> to be of the eſſence of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a Rite that may not be changed; for in that caſe it is neceſſary for the Truths ſake to informe them otherwiſe, and make it ſeene that wee loue Truth more then our owne reputation. If our iudgements haue beene miſſe-led, and that we haue miſſe-led others, it is good, that we being reſolued of the Truth, helpe to reſolue others alſo. But I doe not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any ſuch ignorance in my brethren; I know, people thinke many times wee contradict our ſelues, when there is nothing leſſe; for they diſtinguiſh not well of things, and haue many miſtakings. Alwayes, this is ſure, the framing of peoples conceits lyes much in our hands. The Dayes requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to bee obſerued, haue beene kept this laſt yeare in the chiefe Burghes by his Maieſties command, what offence thereof did we find amongſt the people? The Communion hath beene giuen and receiued in that reuerend forme, Who was ſcandalized? Some few, perhaps, that would ſeeme ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular for holineſſe by the reſt, and others becauſe they ſaw their Miniſters forbeare: but generally ſuch as communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, who were not a few number, profeſſed that in their time they neuer found more comfort and better motions, which their teares and deuout behauiour teſtified to all the beholders.</p>
                        <pb n="43" facs="tcp:26266:36"/>
                        <p>But this, they ſay, takes not away the offence: for Papiſts will boaſt, that wee are drawing backe towards them, and the godly cannot but be grieued, that haue a diſlike of their Ceremonies. For Papiſts, firſt, wee are not to regard them, It is their manner to make aduantage of euery thing: ſay or doe what wee will, they will ſtill ſpeake euill of the Truth. Are the Churches of England, Germany, and Bohemie in better termes with Papiſts, then wee? Yee know not how things goe in the world, if yee thinke ſo. Papiſts are not the fooles we take them, to be pleaſed with ſhadowes, they haue other more ſubſtantiall notes, by which they diſcerne their friends, then by ceremonies. As for the godly amongſt vs, wee are ſorry they ſhould bee grieued, but it is their owne fault: for if the things be in themſelues lawfull, what is it that ſhould offend them? They ſay, theſe alterations can worke no good. I anſwer, The alteration is neceſſary, if it bee neceſſary for our Church to inioy his Maieſties fauour, and if it be neceſſary, it muſt alſo be profitable. <hi>Nam cauſa neceſſitatis, &amp; vtilitatis aequiparantur in iure.</hi> But if they thinke that we ſhould regard their offence, and offence of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good Chriſtians, let them know that the offence of our gracious Soueraigne is more to vs then theirs, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fand moe.</p>
                        <p>Yet were it not better, that his Maieſtie ſhould by his authoritie inioyne them, rather then the Church giue any conſent, and when the time ſhall grow better, we may then returne to our old cuſtome? for theſe are the motions of ſome. What they call better times, I know not, but our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſaw neuer ſo good times, nor is it to be hoped that our poſteritie ſhall ſee the like. Continuance detracts from the worth of things, at leaſt in our conceits: wee haue enioyed peace and libertie ſo long, that we little know how precious they are. But had we beene in the coates of our fathers, or could wee remember the ſtraits our firſt Reformers ſtood in, and were brought vnto in the ſame Citie, when that good Earle <hi>Alexander</hi> came to their reliefe, wee would thinke it
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:26266:37"/>no ſmall bleſſing to haue our Profeſſion countenanced by Authoritie. As to that which they deſire, that his Maieſtie ſhould inioyn theſe things by Authoritie, I leaue it to you to iudge how dangerous the ſame may proue to the Church. If co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formity be enioyned, be ſure it wil not be in theſe matters only, but in others that yee hate more: But I feare it be the purpoſe of many to rubbe this way vpon his Maieſty the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of tyrannie: for what Chriſtian King did euer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine in Eccleſiaſticall matters any thing without aduice of his Clergie? And to impoſe Lawes vpon the Church without their conſent, were as much as to ſay, the King im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes things vnlawfull: for if they be lawfull, Why will wee be diſſenting? Brethren, his Maieſtie is ſtyled, <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> and hath it by deſert, aſwell as by inheritance: It were a peruerſe courſe for vs to make it ſeeme otherwayes. When Ieſuites and Papiſts of all ſorts, are by their infamous writings, belying his Maieſtie, and traducing his Highneſſe fame, onely becauſe he oppoſes them for the defence of the common Faith; if wee ſhould furniſh them matter of new obloquie by our rebellion, we could neuer be excuſed of vile ingratitude. Reſts but one obiection that I haue heard, which I will not omit: They ſay, the Engliſh Church hath beene ſeeking of old times to haue vs wonder their gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and vpon this, ſome haue called our yeelding vnto a conformitie in theſe points with them, a betraying of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of our Church and Kingdome. This reaſon is ſo euill grounded, that though we ſhould conforme with them in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery outward Rite, obſerued not onely by them but by the whole Church of Chriſt, long before it was ſo infected with Poperie: it would not inferre the dependance of our Church vpon theirs, but that there is that harmony and conformitie amongſt vs, which ought to bee amongſt all the reformed Churches both in Doctrine and Diſcipline. And for our part in maintayning our right, yee may remember not long ſince, when that Noble man was abſolued in England who was excommunicate by vs, wee ceaſſed not to complaine vntill a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:26266:37"/>new command was giuen, that hee ſhould receiue from vs a new abſolution. If matters ſhould come thus to be conteſted for, which is not to bee expected, wee ſhould not bee found neglectful either of our Church or Country. But what is this we are iealous of? We lius vnder a King, that loues the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes honour more then we all; there offers not one occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, wherein his Maieſtie failes to expreſſe his naturall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards his country. Euen now that <hi>Miſchant,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one of your number, and vnworthy to be named, did vomit forth his ſpite and vnnatural malice againſt the whole Nation: And how did his Maieſtie reſent it? As I haue beene aduertiſed, he did ſolemnely declare, That albeit much had beene ſaid againſt his Maieſties owne perſon, and nothing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in that kinde, which the Deuill could inuent, yet all that did not ſo much grieue him, as that <hi>Miſchants</hi> taxing of his Country and Nation: He is not worthy the name, I will not ſay of a Chriſtian, but of a Scottiſh man, that will not, if need be, lay downe his life to meet his Maieſties affection. I know yee are ready enough to make your proteſtations this way, but beleeue me, he ſhall neuer hazard willingly his life for his Prince, who ſtands againſt his pleaſure in ſo iuſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
                        <p>I will ſay no more, for I haue wearied both you and my ſelfe, out of a deſire to giue ſatisfaction to you all. How free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and plainly I haue ſpoken, ye are my witneſſes: with what an affection towards the Churches good, God hee knowes. Brethren, wee haue made too much buſineſſe about theſe matters. The Kingdome of God conſiſts not in them, but in righteouſneſſe and peace, and ioy of the holy Ghoſt. Away with fruitleſſe and contentious diſputings. Remember the worke wee are ſent for, is to build the Church of God, and not to deſtroy it; to call men to Faith and Repentance; to ſtirre them vp to the works of true pietie and loue, and not to make them thinke they haue Religion enough when they haue talked againſt Biſhops and Ceremonies. If wee ſhall goe about this carefully, and all of vs ſtriue in our places, by
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:26266:38"/>fruitfull preaching, honeſt liuing, and a wiſe gouerning, to approue our ſelues vnto the conſciences of our people, wee ſhall ſhortly finde matters in a better eſtate then wee haue ſeene, and be all of vs an acceptable people to the Lord our God; which that it may bee, God for his Chriſts ſake grant to vs all. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>THe Sermon ended, the Archbiſhop of Saint <hi>Andrewes</hi> came to the Table, at which his Maieſties Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Noble men, and other members of the Aſſembly, were ſitting; and calling for the ordinarie Clerke of the Aſſembly, was anſwered, That Maſter <hi>Thomas Nicholſon,</hi> who former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerued the Church in that place, had dimitted his office in fauour of Maſter <hi>Iames Sandelands</hi> Aduocate; This he noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to the Aſſembly, as that which hee had vnderſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and ſhewed that the ſaid Maſter <hi>Iames</hi> was a man ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently qualified for the place, of good report, and one that by his aduocation and pleading might further the particular buſineſſe of Miniſters before the Seſſion. He deſired the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly to conſider what was fitteſt to bee done, and aduiſe whether they would receiue the ſaid Maſter <hi>Iames</hi> in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers place or not: The voyces of his Maieſties Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the Noble men, Biſhops, and diuers of the Miniſters being asked, they all without exception agreed to his recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. And the ſaid Maſter <hi>Iames</hi> being recalled (for while the voyces were asked, he was remoued) had an oath mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred vnto him, for his diligent and faithfull diſcharge of that ſeruice.</p>
            <p>The Libeller obſerues here, firſt, That ſeates being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for Noble men, Barons, Burgeſſes, and Biſhops, with the Doctors; the Miniſters were left to ſtand behinde them as if their part had onely beene to behold; Then ſayes, that the chooſing of Maſter <hi>Iames Sandelands</hi> to be Clerke, was done without formall voting or lite. But to that, firſt, although it might bee replyed in a word, that the care of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:26266:38"/>placing ſeates was onely in the Magiſtrates hands of the Burghe, where the ſaid Aſſembly was kept, and that the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect thereof, if any was, cannot be thought purpoſely done; yet becauſe no diligence was omitted on the part of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, and the ſeates conueniently enough placed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the houſe could beare, wherein the ſaid meeting was kept; wee muſt thinke this complaint proceeds of too much pride and ſawcineſſe. The man cannot abide to heare of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in the Church, and places according to degrees; but he muſt haue patience. Presbyters muſt now content to ſit and ſtand behind the Biſhops, according to the degrees of the old Chriſtian Councels; for the time of confuſion is expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and Church men muſt learne now to liue orderly. That there was not a lite for election of the Clerke, hee muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that the dimiſſion made by the former, was in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of Maſter <hi>Iames</hi> onely; and that the Aſſembly had not ſo much adoe to chooſe a Clerke, as to aduiſe, if they would accept him, in whoſe fauour the dimiſſion was made. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which point, the voyces of the moſt, that could bee obſerued to bee preſent, being asked, enough was done for making good his reception in the place, ſpecially conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Commiſſioners to the Aſſembly were not then knowne, nor a roll made whereby to call them, that had voyce particularly. But this is his curioſitie, who gladly would find a fault, euen where none was committed.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Maſter <hi>Iames Sandelands</hi> being admitted, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was giuen to all that had entereſſe in the ſaid Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, to giue in their commiſſions to him before the next ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and nomination was made of certayne for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, according to the order kept in other Aſſemblies; in which beſides the Biſhops, Noble men, Barons, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of Burrowes, the moſt wiſe and learned of the Miniſtrie were named indifferently, without any reſpect had of their opinions and priuate inclinations.</p>
            <p>At this time it was moued by one, That the libertie of the Church might bee kept in the chooſing of a Moderator;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:26266:39"/>which the Archbiſhop of Saint <hi>Andrewes</hi> repreſſed, ſaying to the proponer, That he did not expect him to be a troubler of the Church, and the buſineſſe thereof; and that the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly was met within the bounds of his charge, wherein ſo long as he ſerued, he truſted none would vſurpe; at which he kept ſilence; and ſtreight wayes aroſe another, who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked whether all the Noble men and Barons preſent ſhould haue voyce, or not, and if the whole Miniſters that were met there, ſhould haue voyces alſo: The Archbiſhop of Saint <hi>Andrews</hi> anſwered, that the order obſerued in former Aſſemblies ſhould here be kept, and no Miniſters haue voyce that lacked a commiſſion: But as for Noble men, and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons who were come thither vpon his Maieſties miſſiues, he truſted none there would denie them voyce, ſpecially ſince in the Aſſembly that proceeded at Saint <hi>Andrewes,</hi> it was one of the reaſons they made for differring the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of matters, That none of the Noble men, or Barons were then preſent to aſſiſt the proceedings of the Church.</p>
            <p>It was deſired alſo, that the Articles to bee entreated, might bee extended in ſuch forme, as his Maieſtie deſired them to paſſe, and that ſome might be ſet apart to collect the reaſons that ſhould be proponed, for, or againſt the Articles, that the whole Aſiembly might haue the cleerer informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To this it was anſwered, that the conference was to conſider of theſe things, and what might ſerue beſt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare matters for the whole Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>It appeared, that their drift was to perturbe the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly with ſuch motions in the beginning, therefore the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop requiring them to keepe ſilence, commanded his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties letter which was preſented by <hi>Doctor Young</hi> Deane of <hi>Winchester,</hi> and directed to the Aſſembly, to be publikely read, the Tenor of which Letter wee haue thoughr meete here alſo to inſert.</p>

You pleade much, Wee perceiue, to haue matters done by conſent of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and tell <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s often, that, what concernes the Church in generall, ſhould be concluded, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe of the whole; neither doe Wee altogether diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like your purpoſe: for the greater conſent there is amongſt your ſelues, the greater is Our contentment. But We will not haue you to thinke, that matters proponed by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s of that nature, whereof theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles are, may not without ſuch a generall conſent be enioyned by Our authoritie: This were a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing of your places, and withall a diſclayming of that innate power, which We haue by Our calling from God, by the which, We haue place to diſpoſe of things externall in the Church, as We ſhall thinke them to be conuenient, and profitable for aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing true Religion amongſt Our Subiects. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let it be your care by all manner of wiſe, and diſcreete perſwaſions to induce them to an obedient yeelding vnto theſe things, as in dutie both to God, and Vs, they are bound: And doe not thinke, that

And it ſhould haue rather becommed you, to haue begged the eſtabliſhment of ſuch things of Vs, then that We ſhould thus neede to be put to vrge the practiſe of them, vpon you. Theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters indeede concerneth you of the Eccleſiaſticall charge chiefly.

Neither thinke We, that any Prince liuing could haue kept himſelfe from falling in vtter diſlike with the Profeſsion it ſelfe, conſidering the many prouocations that were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto Vs; But the loue of God, and his truth ſtill vpheld Vs; And will by his grace ſo doe vnto the end of Our life: Our patience alwayes in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting, and forgiuing many faults of that ſort, and conſtant maintaining of true Religion againſt the aduerſaries (by whoſe hatefull practiſes We liue in greater perill then you all, or any one of you,) ſhould haue produced better effects amongſt you, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall reſiſtance of our best purpoſes.

            <p>THis Letter being once read, and againe, as is the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome in all Letters of importance ſent from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie: The Archbiſhop reſumed the heads of the ſame, ſhewing how acceptable their acceptance would bee, and on the otherſide, what inconuenients their refuſe might bring vpon the Church; hee declared alſo vnto them, how they ſhould bee well aduiſed before they thruſt themſelues wilfully in danger, becauſe whatſoeuer forwardneſſe, ſome amongſt them ſeemed to haue for ſuffering in ſuch caſes, they ſhould or long fore-thinke the ſame: and after they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled of the troubles of baniſhment a little, would, as others had done, ſeeke home againe; and acknowledge their ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſights. Of this he told them, they had examples many, not one before their eyes; and becauſe the very night before he had receiued a Letter from Maſter <hi>Iohn Shairpe,</hi> who was exiled the Kingdome, for keeping that diſordered Conuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle at <hi>Abirdene:</hi> contayning an earneſt requeſt, to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede with his Maieſtie for libertie to returne into his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, with aſſurance he would conforme himſelfe to all good orders in time comming, hee made particular mention of him, and of the Letter, giuing the young man his due com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation for his good behauiour, and the profit hee had made in his Studies, ſince the time of his Baniſhment. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought them to be wife, and not to commit any thing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of afterwards they might repent, to the diſgrace both of themſelues and their Miniſterie.</p>
            <p>This was the effect of his firſt ſpeech, which the Libeller ſo depraues, as hee would make you thinke, that hee lackt both iudgement to conceiue, and dexteritie to vtter that which was meete to be ſpoken in ſuch an audience; but they are witneſſes enow to confute his folly, and falſhood in that particular. The like imputation he goes about to lay vpon Doctor <hi>Young,</hi> the Deane of Wincheſter, whom in one place he cals a Scottiſhman by birth, as if he were now degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and had forgotten, or forſaken his Countrey: And in another place ſcornfully taxeth, for the manner of his ſpeech

            <p>It is true, that by reaſon of the truſt, and credit commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, by his Maieſty in this buſineſſe; the Archbiſhop of Saint-<hi>Andrewes</hi> deſired him to ſpeake, if ſo hee had any thing to ſay for ſeconding the Letter, whereof he was Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger, and his words receiued at that time, by one that ſtood by, were theſe that followes.</p>

And therefore I deſire (as I am ſent to that purpoſe) with the Apostle <hi>Titus 3.</hi> to put you in remembrance, that you bee ſubiect to Principalities and powers, and that you bee obedient and ready to euery good worke: to put you in remembrance, that by the great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Almightie God, you haue to doe with ſo wiſe, ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, ſo religious, ſo learned a Prince, the matchleſſe Mirror of all Kings, the nurſing Father of his Church; that he whoſe Wiſedome and Authoritie, is in the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of all differences both Eccleſiaſticall and Ciuill, ſo much required, reſpected, and admired, not only by his owne people of his other Kingdomes, but by all good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of forrein Nations throughout the Chriſtian world may not ſeeme to be neglected by you his natiue Subiects at home, and you eſpecially of the Miniſteric, who ought to be examples and patternes of obedience vnto others; you whom he hath ſo infinitely obliged by his ſo great bountie and conſtant loue: To put you in remembrance, that as with no ſmall diſreputation vnto his Maieſtie, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution as it were of his Princely authoritie in the iudgement and ſight of the World, whoſe eyes are bent vpon theſe proceedings, he hath granted you ſo long time, by your Christian and godly endeuours with your ſeuerall flockes (whom you are to leade, &amp; not to be led by them) to remoue (as you promiſed both to his Maiesty being here amongſt you, and againe confirmed at your laſt generall Synod,) all thoſe ſcandals which might be taken by the more ignorant and vnaduiſed ſort of your people (to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:26266:44"/>whom all innouations though to the better, may ſeeme at the first ſomewhat ſtrange:) ſo that now you would bee carefull, as much as in you lyeth, to take away that more dangerous and open offence, and ſcandall, which by your delay, and refuſall of obedience, you ſhall cast vpon the ſacred perſon of our Soueraigne Lord the King; the moſt conſtant, and zealous Protectour and Defender of that Faith and Truth, which wee all profeſſe, and for the which he hath ſuffered ſuch open gaine-ſaying of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries thereof, the limbes of Antichriſt; as if hee who hath laboured ſo much to exalt the glorie of this Nation farre aboue all his Predeceſſours in the eyes of the World, now going about most of all to humble vs vnto our God, and in performance of the act of greateſt deuotion according to his owne example to bring vs vnto our Knees, did in ſo doing any way vrge his Subiects to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, which might ſauour of Superstition or Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie: To remoue the ſcandall from thoſe who are in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity amongſt you, and are ſet ouer you in the Lord, who by their dutifull obedience vnto God, and their Soueraigne, haue alreadie both by their Doctrine, and practiſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended thoſe things which now are required of you, to be both lawfull, and expedient: To take away that ſcandall and aſperſion, which by the ſeeming reaſons of your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer refuſall, or delay, you haue caſt vpon others ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reformed Churches, as if the holy Ghoſt, and Spirit of reformation had beene giuen onely, and ſolely reſted vpon you: To remoue that notorious, and publique ſcandall, which by the fierie and turbulent ſpirits of ſome few priuate men, lyeth heauie vpon the feruent and zealous Profeſſours of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt, as if they
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:26266:44"/>alſo were diſobedient vnto Magiſtracie, and in this did ſeeme to ioyne hands with the maine vpholders, and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of Poperie. It hath wounded the Spirits of good men to heare it often ſpoken, <hi>Nec dicatur, (vtinam am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliùs) Gathi, &amp; in plateis Aſchelonis;</hi> Nay to ſee it in Print, that <hi>Herod,</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> were now reconciled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if not <hi>Contra Chriſtum Dominum,</hi> yet <hi>contra Chriſtum Domini.</hi> Laſtly, to preuent that lamentable miſerie and calamitie, which God in his iuſtice might bring vpon this Church, in that you regarded not the bleſſed time of your viſitation, and deſpiſed the long ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and great goodneſſe of God, and of ſo bountifull and gracious a Soueraigne. And ſo to conclude, (for to ſtand now vpon the particulars were but <hi>actum agere,</hi> and you need no gleanings after ſo plentifull an harueſt, or the light of a Candle being inlightned by the cleare beames of the Sunne,) with that of <hi>Naamans</hi> ſeruants, <hi>2.</hi> King. <hi>5.</hi> vnto their Lord, and Maiſter: Father, if the Prophet had commanded thee a greater matter, ſhouldeſt thou not haue done it? &amp;c. So, right reuerend Fathers and Brethren in Chriſt, if our moſt gracious Soueraigne Lord, who hath done ſo much for you, had commanded you greater things, ſo long as they might ſtand with the will of God, and in no waies be repugnant vnto the ſame, (for in that caſe indeed, the Apoſtles rule holds inuiolably true

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Conference, after Prayer made for a bleſſing to that meeting, his Maieſties Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was read againe, to put them in minde that were conuened of the buſineſſe in hand, at what time the Archbiſhop of Saint-<hi>Andrewes</hi> did remember them of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings that had beene kept in theſe matters ſince his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties firſt Propoſition of them at Saint-ANDREWES: The promiſes made at that time to his Maieſtie for paſſing the ſaid Articles: the delay made in the preceding Aſſembly vpon pretext of ſatisfying the ſimple and ignorant ſort tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the lawfulneſſe of them: Hee toln them alſo of the offence which his Maieſtie had taken at that delay: the ſeuere<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/> rer courſe that was intended againſt the diſobedient Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters: and the mitigation which was procured by the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble interceſſion of himſelfe and others: and hereupon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought them earneſtly to doe, as became wiſemen; for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit as he perceiued againſt the aduice giuen in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Synods they were come thither almoſt all of them, who were diſpoſed to reſiſt the concluſion intended, and that they ſuppoſed to carry matters by voyces without regard, what reaſon would craue of them, they would deceiue themſelues in that caſe, and finde their numbers too weake, if they did not hearken, and ſubmit themſelues to reaſon. And in the end, ſhewing them the end of their ſitting apart was to conſider, by what meanes matters might moſt eaſily be brought vnto a point, hee ſaid that there appeared but two wayes, one whereof was by diſputing the Articles,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:26266:46"/>which was likely to conſume along time, and breed irritati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, rather then any contentment elſe: The other was by a calme and wiſe conſultation to conſider how the ſaid Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles might bee receiued in all the Churches with leaſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and conclude the ſame; ſpecially ſince they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in the laſt Aſſembly to reſolue themſelues and others, of the equitie of the points required; and which they like beſt, he deſires them to chooſe.</p>
            <p>The greater part eſteeming, that ſuch as were contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry minded, would neuer receiue ſatisfaction, vnleſſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were firſt reaſoned: and that it ſhould bring a ſore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation vpon the Aſſembly to conclude any thing, which had not beene firſt debated by arguments, vrged the diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Articles, which was of the reſt condeſcended vnto. Then it being proponed, if they would take the ſaid Articles in order, or beginne with the moſt controuerted, they agreed vniformely to treate of kneeling at the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the holy Sacrament in the firſt place, hoping that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction being giuen in that Article, the leſſe ſcruple ſhould be made of the reſt.</p>
            <p>So according to the order, two were named to diſpute that Arcicle, to wit, Doctor <hi>Henrie Philip,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Forbes</hi> for the one ſide; and Maſter <hi>William Scot,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Iohn Carmichael</hi> for the other: theſe two laſt named, after a graue proteſtation made, of their vnwillingneſſe to be heard oppoſing to any matter, for the which his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie ſeemed ſo earneſt, excuſed themſelues by the neceſſity of the Commandement, and their owne reſolutions, which they held to bee well grounded, wiſhing that no offence might be taken at their ſpeeches, which they ſhould be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of, and ſay nothing, but with that reuerence which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them in ſo honourable an hearing. And then adding, that the contrary order had beene long time kept in this Church with great profit, and the comfort of many good Chriſtians, if now any would preaſſe to aboliſh that which had beene in force, and draw in things not yet receiued, they
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:26266:46"/>ſhould bee holden to prooue, eyther that the things vrged were neceſſary and expedient for our Church: or the order hitherto kept, not meet to be retayned. And for this purpoſe they alleadged a paſſage of Maſter <hi>Hooker,</hi> in his Preface before the Bookes of <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Policie,</hi> wherein hee craues that ſuch as ſeeke the reformation of Orders Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall in the Church of England, ſhould content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with the Opponents part, and bee ſubiect to prooue theſe two things mentioned. It was replyed, that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of their caſe and ours, was great: for there a few pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate men deſired the Lawes publikely eſtabliſhed to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, and it was good reaſon that ſuch ſhould bee put to their confirmation of what they proponed: but heere the Prince, that by himſelfe had power to reforme ſuch things as were amiſſe in the outward policie, required to haue the change made. And therefore it concerned them to bring reaſons, why his Maieſties Propoſitions ought not to bee granted. This they declined for a great while, ſtill proteſting the reuerence they beare to his Maieſties commandements; and without mentioning that which they would not oppoſe in <hi>Theſi,</hi> they wiſhed this queſtion to be reaſoned: <hi>Whether kneeling, or ſitting at the Communion were the fitter geſture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was anſwered that the queſtion could bee no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes proponed then thus; <hi>His Maieſtie deſires our geſture of ſitting at the Communion to be changed into kneeling: Why ought not the ſame to be done?</hi> If it could bee ſhewed by the Word, or by any neceſſary conſequent deduced out of the ſame, that his alteration craued, ought not to bee granted, becauſe impious or vnlawfull, that ſhould bee enough hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to decline the deſire; which wee doubted not his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie would accept well: and if otherwayes, they could bring no argument to the contrary, a neceſſitie lay vpon vs to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey.</p>
            <p>An houre, or more was ſpent in ſuch ſpeeches, they decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſtill to giue any argument, and offering themſelues to anſwere ſuch reaſons, as any man would propone for the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:26266:47"/>alteration deſired: whereupon the Archbiſhop of Saint-<hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes</hi> ſaid, that if none would reaſon, hee would put the Articles to voyces.</p>
            <p>Then they proponed that reaſoning ſhould bee publike, and in face of the whole Aſſembly: it was replyed, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould be in conference concluded to the preiudice of the Aſſembly; alwayes matters muſt firſt be brought to ſome point in the conference, and thereafter proponed to the whole number, who ſhould be heard to reaſon of new, if he liſted.</p>
            <p>Hereupon they reſolued to fall into the diſpute, and firſt Maſter <hi>Iohn Carmichael</hi> brought an Argument from the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome and practice of the Church of Scotland, which had beene long obſerued, and ought not to bee altered, except the inconuenience of the preſent order were ſhewed, and the deſired geſture qualified to bee better. It was anſwered, that how euer the Argument held good againſt the motions of priuate men, yet his Maieſtie requiring the practice to be changed, matters behoued to admit a new conſideration; and that becauſe it was the Prince his Priuiledge, that had the conſeruation and cuſtodie, aſwell of the Church, as of the Common-wealth, to call in queſtion Cuſtomes and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes which he perceiued to breed any inconuenience in the ſtate euen by himſelfe, it could not bee denyed that in a Church Aſſembly, ſuch as that was, his Maieſtie might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully craue an innouation of any Church Rite, which hee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed not to be conuenient for the time.</p>
            <p>From this Argument, they went to another of Chriſt and the Diſciples ſitting at the firſt inſtitution, in diſcuſſing whereof, they were brought to acknowledge the geſture not to bee of the eſſence of the Sacrament, but alterable at the diſcretion of the Church. Only they held the cuſtome formerly receiued to be the better.</p>
            <p>This was the proceeding of the firſt Conference, wherein becauſe matters could not be brought to any point, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation was made to the morrow after, and they warned to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:26266:47"/>meete againe at eight of the clocke in the morning. The Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller affirmes the Propoſitions made by them touching the order of diſpute, and the reſt to haue beene reiected by the Moderator, adding, that he determined by himſelfe; and that the fewer Reaſons proponed by the Miniſters, were cut off by cauilling and quarrelling at mens perſons: whereas a number are witneſſes, and can well remember, that they were heard with patience, to alledge what they could, and anſwered in that which they proponed till themſelues could ſay no more, and that nothing was done, but according to the cuſtome kept in ſuch caſes in all Aſſemblies.</p>

               <p>THe Conference being met as was appointed, after inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Name of God, the Reaſoners were deſired to proceed where they had left the night before, and not to trifle time with ſpeeches of ſmall conſequence; which was the effect of all the diſcourſes the Libeller ſeemes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of. The reaſoning continued from eight vnto eleuen of the clocke. And when the whole Reaſons proponed, by the two forenamed, were in the iudgement of all men ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, others were required, and had place giuen them to propone their Arguments alſo, which was done in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and with ſuch modeſtie as could be wiſhed.</p>
               <p>It were needleſſe here to repeate the ſeuerall Arguments and Anſwers, ſeeing they are all in the Diſputation ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent at large ſet downe; onely where the Libeller ſayes. That reaſoning was cut off, and the Article of kneeling put to voyces: It is true, that nothing remayning to bee ſaid more in that head then was proponed, the Archbiſhop de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired theſe of the Conference, to giue their iudgement in the matter reaſoned. They opponed, that the cuſtome was not to vote in Conference any matter, before it were brought to the full Aſſembly, but it was proued otherwiſe by theſe
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:26266:48"/>who had frequented the Aſſemblies, both of old and in the latter times; as likewiſe it was told them, that theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences reſembled the meeting of the Lords of Articles in Parliament, where matters are accuſtomed to bee prepared and put in order, before they bee proponed to the whole State. And that the voting in Conference was by way of aduice onely, and not to determine: The power whereof belonged onely to the Aſſembly. This being acknowledged by the whole number to bee ſo, they offered that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to giue their owne iudgement without preiudging the Aſſembly; as accordingly they did: The whole number, ſome ten or eleuen excepted, declaring that by the Reaſons proponed, or any thing elſe they conceiued, they could not deny, but a change might bee made of the geſture in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the holy Sacrament, and that it ſeemed to them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient for the Church to embrace the Article proponed by his Maieſtie about kneeling, in regard of his deſire and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to haue the ſame forme here eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>The Libeller either forgetting himſelfe or miſſe-infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med (for by the whole Narration he makes, it would ſeeme, hee was not preſent himſelfe) caſts this in the after-noones Conference, though the ſame was done in the morning; but this, any man may well thinke, is but a light errour, yet it may appeare by this, how little the Narration he makes is to be regarded; for he brings in the Moderator in that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, ſaying to ſuch as conuened, That the Article of kneeling was concluded by the Conference: and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after ſayes, That the ſame was put to voyces; where it is ſtrange, the Moderator ſhould ſo forget himſelfe, as to ſay a thing was voted, and incontinent propone the ſame to bee voted againe, but this we will paſſe. After the aduice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to bee giuen to the Aſſembly in this point, it was thought meet, that the Article preſently reaſoned, with the other Articles proponed by his Maieſtie, ſhould all of them be formed in the beſt and moſt agreeable words that could bee deuiſed, for remouing all offence that might bee taken at
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:26266:48"/>the ſame, and no aduantage giuen to the Aduerſaries of the Truth; and to this effect were named ſome graue and wiſe Brethren, who were deſired to haue the ſame in readineſſe at foure of the clocke in the after-noone; it being thought meet, that the full Aſſembly ſhould not meet before Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day againe, at which time all might be prepared.</p>

               <p>ALbeit the meeting of the full Aſſembly was differred to the next day, yet that after-noone, the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thronging in, whether that they were not aduertiſed of the delay, or that they deſired to bee preſent with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, came thither; which the Archbiſhop perceiuing, he tooke occaſion to excuſe the delay of meeting with them, declaring how farre they had proceeded, and that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference had committed the Articles to bee formed, vnto cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne Brethren, who were at that time to preſent them; and therefore deſired they ſhould haue patience till the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and leaue the Conference for that time by themſelues, which they did.</p>
               <p>How ſoone they were remoued, theſe who were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to forme the Articles, being inquired what they had done, anſwered, That they had formed the Article about kneeling, but had no leiſure to conſider of the reſt; This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing read, which they had put in forme, was well liked of, and they required to haue the reſt in readineſſe at the time of the Aſſemblies meeting the next day.</p>
               <p>The Libeller here remembers a word that eſcaped the Moderator, while as they reſiſted ſo importunately the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Articles in Conference, ſaying, That hee would commit twentie preiudices to pleaſe the King: whereas the truth is, that after many anſwers made to giue them ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ſhew that no preiudice was either intended or done to the Aſſembly, when as nothing could content them,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:26266:49"/>but ſtill they talked of preiudice, he willed them to be quiet; for rather then his Maieſtie ſhould offend with the Church, and theſe troubles come vpon it, which were iuſtly to bee feared, hee would commit twentie ſuch preiudices as theſe were.</p>
               <p>The reſt of that after-noone was ſpent in talking, as the Libeller ſayes, vpon Simony, &amp;c. but in the deuiſing ſome ouerture for the reſtrayning of that abuſe, to bee proponed to the whole Aſſembly, which the next day after was by v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall conſent allowed: As likewiſe, the Commiſſion for the planting of the Church of Edinburgh, and the forming of the booke of Common Prayers, and extracting of the Canons of the Church. And thus ended this Conference.</p>

               <p>THat day being an ordinary day of preaching, a Sermon was made by the reuerend Father in God <hi>William</hi> late Biſhop of <hi>Galloway,</hi> againſt which the Libeller excepts three manner of wayes; Firſt, ſaying that his Doctrine was farre contrary to that which he had taught before the Eſtates of Parliament Anno 1606. Secondly, that hee ſet at nought, the ancient order of our Church, ſometime highly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by himſelfe, extolling the new light; and thirdly, that he preſumed to teach them a new kind of Catechiſme, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whom he himſelfe might be yet catechiſed. To all which ſeeing he is now at reſt, this much may be truely replyed in his behalfe, That howeuer his opinion in theſe matters of the externall gouerment were ſometimes other, his Doctrine was neuer contrarie to that, which at any time he profeſſed, and preached: but theſe men haue beene ſo accuſtomed in feeding the eares of people with matters belonging to order, neglecting the ſubſtantiall points of Religion, which are, Faith and Repentance, as they dreame of no other Doctrine but that; and counts the alteration of iudgement in theſe
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:26266:49"/>points of outward diſcipline a ſort of Apoſtaſie, and falling from the truth. And where he is ſaid to ſet at nought, the ancient order of our Church, it is a falſe and impudent lye; for neither he, nor any elſe, that ſeeme moſt earneſt for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing theſe Articles, did euer contemne the orders, and rites formerly eſtabliſhed, but while as they ſtood in force, reuerently practiſed them, and were obedient to the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Church made thereabout; but the circumſtances of things now being changed, and theſe times requiring o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faſhions and manners, wee thinke without the deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of theſe, they may be well admitted, and as commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably vſed, as euer the other were: For the third, of preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to teach them, by whom he might be catechized, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this is ſpoken in deſpight, I paſſe it with this anſwere, That his Sermons, and workes left behind him, which will continue with the poſteritie, will witneſſe againſt all their malice, that hee was inferiour to none of the Oppoſites in preaching, yea, in many degrees ſuperiour to them all.</p>
               <p>But to returne to our purpoſe; the Aſſembly being not in full number, to take ſome concluſion in the buſineſſe, for which they were conuened, after inuocation of the Name of God, it was declared vnto them, that by the labours of the Conference in their priuate meetings, the Articles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned by his Maieſtie, were brought and reduced into that forme, as it reſted for the Aſſembly to conſider, whether or not, the ſame ſhould be receiued in our Church; and to moue them the rather to condeſcend, his Maieſties reſolution, to haue the Articles receiued, was declared, and how no other anſwere could ſatisfie, but granting of the ſaid Articles. They were likewiſe remembred of their promiſes made to his Maieſties ſelfe at Saint <hi>Andrewes</hi> and in the laſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Aſſembly, and had the lawfulneſſe, and indifferencie of theſe matters at length of new exponed vnto them: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was any of their common pretexts left vnanſwered, place being giuen to all, that would reaſon againſt any one of the Articles, to doe the ſame. And while ſome of them
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:26266:50"/>inſiſted by long ſpeeches to haue a continuation made of matters to another Aſſembly, and a ſupplication ſent to his Maieſtie for ſome longer delay, his Highneſſe Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners hauing vrged a preſent anſwere, they were deſired to ceaſe, and not to trifle time, with vnneceſſary ſpeeches, ſeeing matters ſhould receiue deciſion before they went forth of doores.</p>
               <p>And ſo ſome few making ſhew to reaſon in the contrary, were permitted to ſpeake, till they had no more to ſay, and had their reaſons anſwered to the full. The Libeller ſayes, the libertie was granted to a few, and that the reaſons were checkt, and borne downe with authoritie; but how contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie this is to the truth, wee leaue it to bee anſwered by ſuch as were preſent. And now when they haue ſet downe in writing, all that then was ſaid, or poſſibly they can inuent, Let the Reader iudge, if by the anſweres giuen, their obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions be not ſufficiently confuted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctor Lindſay</hi> his anſwere, being poſed on conſcience to declare his iudgement touching kneeling at the Sacrament, is maliciouſly mutilated: His declaration was this, as all the Aſſembly can teſtifie, in whoſe preſence it was giuen: On my conſcience I neither know Scripture, reaſon, nor antiquitie that enforceth kneeling, ſitting, ſtanding, or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, as neceſſary, but thinke them all indifferent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that any of them may bee lawfully vſed, when it is found expedient. And conſidering nothing to be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for the weale of our Church, then to keepe peace with our gracious Soueraigne, and not to contend for ſuch matters, I iudge, yeelding to his Highneſſe deſire, to bee the onely beſt.</p>
               <p>When all the reaſoning was ended, his Maieſties Letter was againe read, to the end the Aſſembly might ſee his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſſe about the ſame matters. And becauſe of a Paſquill caſt in, in the Pulpit of Edinburghe the Sunday before, which was deliuered to the Archbiſhop of Saint <hi>Andrewes,</hi> the penners whereof had warned the Miniſters not to yeeld
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:26266:50"/>to the Articles, giuing them promiſes of ſatisfaction for their ſtipends, in caſe they ſhould be taken from them, and to fight in the defence of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; that cauſe: He diſſwaded them to leane vnto ſuch ſuggeſtions, or be moued with them, for that they would proue nought in the end, as the experience of the ſeuenteene dayes worke might teach them. And ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which he is not aſhamed of, nor will denie, That were there no other to take imployment againſt theſe Mutiners, and ſeditious perſons, he could wiſh, that he were honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red therewith.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the great blaſts, and terrours, which the Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler mentions; otherwaies they can take exception at nothing iuſtly that then was vittered.</p>
               <p>As matters were then proponed, to be voted, one of that number gaue in writing ſome particular reaſons, for diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the grant of the ſaid Articles, which they haue now writ, and imprinted in this Pamphlet; which beeing ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as the Libeller ſpeakes, to be ſome ſeditious proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Preferrer thereof was aduertiſed to take heede to his doing, and giue in no Libels, which hee did not ſet his hand vnto: This while he offered himſelfe to doe, the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Saint-Andrewes beeing loath to bring him that way in danger, tooke backe the ſaid Writing, and deſired the Clerk of the Aſſembly to reade the ſame: And when they were perceiued to containe no matter of moment, or any new thing, which had not beene before talked of, they were caſt by, as not deſeruing any conſideration.</p>
               <p>Thus the queſtion was made, Whether they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue or refuſe the Articles. Here the Libeller peruerts the queſtion, and ſayes it was this, <hi>Whether yee will conſent to the Articles, or diſobey the King?</hi> which is a queſtion of his own deuiſing; And could not agree, neither with the matter, nor with the perſons. It was deſired by ſome, That the Articles might be ſeuerally voted, pretending that many would agree to ſome of them, who would not accept of all: But that no ſubterfuge might be left or giuen to thoſe that gladly would
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:26266:51"/>hang betweene parties, &amp; ſtriue to pleaſe all, it was thought meeteſt to vote them <hi>in Cumulo,</hi> becauſe the denying of one, would be to his Maieſtie, as the denying of all.</p>
               <p>The Archbiſhop of S. Andrewes taking the roll of names in his owne hand, as it was meete, he ſhould doe, though the Libeller thinke otherwiſe, (for the office of the Clerke is to marke the voices, where they agree, or diſagree, which he cannot eaſily doe, as any may may judge, if he himſelfe reade the Roll; neyther is that cuſtomable in any iudicatorie conſiſting of ſo many perſons, as did this Aſſembly) And cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the names as they ſtood in the roll, where they were found 86. that anſwered <hi>affirmatiue,</hi> granting to the ſaid Articles; and one and fortie onely that denyed, with foure non liquets. The Libeller ſayes, That ſome were called, who wanted Commiſſion, in which he impudently lies, their Commiſſions being extant in the rolls: And that others ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Commiſſion of whoſe Negatiue wee were aſſured, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be called, whereas not any of the whole, was left vnasked. Maiſter <hi>Iohn Murray,</hi> Miniſter at Dumferm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, excepted, who was paſt by, for many reaſons concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himſelfe, not needfull here to be expreſſed.</p>
               <p>As for the order kept in calling of the Roll, it merits no anſwere: And where it hath been ſaid, That the Noblemen, Barons, and Burgeſſes, were thoſe that ſwayed the voices, the moſt of the Miniſtrie beeing againſt it; by the rolls yet extant it is cleare that the whole Laicks that came to this Aſſembly were 31. of whom two were negatiues as the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller confeſſes, and one departed from the Aſſembly before the voting; which whole number being laid aſide, they were ouerſwayed by the voyces of the Eccleſiaſticks to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of eighteene at leaſt.</p>
               <p>And this is the true Narration of all the Proceedings in the ſaid Aſſembly, by which, let any man judge of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellers Diſcourſe, and how little credit is to bee giuen to the ſame: For things are yet freſh in the memorie of ſuch as were preſent, and cannot be forgotten.</p>

               <p>In this Aſſembly concurred all theſe things which yee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire for the lawfull indiction of an Aſſembly: firſt, it was indicted by the ſupreme Magiſtrate, who hath ſufficient power to conuocate generall Aſſemblies, and without whoſe permiſsion no ſuch conuocations can be made. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:26266:52"/>it had the conſent of the former generall Aſſembly at S. Andrews, which by a petition to his Maieſtie, moſt humblie required to grant a new Aſſembly, wherein theſe matters might be more fully conſidered, referring the time, and place to his Maieſties pleaſure. Thirdly, the premonition was made in due time; firſt, becauſe at Eaſter before in the particular Dioceſian Synods, aduertiſement was made to the Brethren to haue their Commiſſioners in readineſſe againſt the time to be deſigned by his Maieſtie. Secondly, the time deſigned after the Proclamation, was ſufficient to haue all the parts of the Countrie aduertiſed. Thirdly, the Biſhops beſides the ſaid Proclamation, gaue lawfull aduertiſement by their Letters to the Miniſters of their Dioceſſe. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the occaſion, and matters to be handled, were well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough knowne to all long before. For the occaſion was by that petition made by the Aſſembly at S.

               <p>None was contemned that had entereſt to bee there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe due premonition was made to all, as it is cleered by the anſwere to the former exception, albeit ſome were abſent, it ſhewes not that they were neglected; for firſt, the abſence might haue happened for diuers other occaſions, ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impeded by ſickneſſe, ſome vnwilling to trauell in that Seaſon of the yeare, and ſome loath to vtter themſelues in the matters queſtioned. Secondly, the abſence of theſe makes not the Aſſembly null; for from theſe farre diſtant High-land Countreyes, as Orknay, Caithnes, Argile, and the Iles which are heere mentioned, few Commiſſioners were euer accuſtomed to come to any Aſſembly heretofore; and to many Aſſemblies none of theſe Countreyes come at all: yet their abſence did not annull the Aſſemblies. But in this Aſſembly there were at the leaſt the Biſhops of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eeſes, who might ſuffice to anſwere for the whole; one only excepted, who was abſent, not for lacke of aduertizement, but becauſe of diſeaſe. Thirdly, if we looke to ancient ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councels in the Primitiue Church, we ſhall find, that the abſence of Biſhops or their Commiſſioners, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned in Countreyes farre diſtant from the place where the Councell was holden, did nothing derogate from the lawfulneſſe thereof: as for example, in that firſt famous Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Nice, there were preſent three hundred and eighteen Biſhops, yet out of all the Occidentall Countreyes, there are only named in the Catalogue ſixteene Biſhops, and two Presbyters Commiſſionaries for the Biſhop of Rome; to wit, out of Spaine, one; out of Egypt, eleuen; out of Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria one; out of Dalmatia one, out of Carthage one, and out of France one; ſo, in the firſt generall Councell at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, there were numbred an hundred and ſiftie Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, whereof only two or three are found to be out of all the Occidentall Nations: In the firſt Councell of Epheſus, there are numbred two hundred Biſhops, and only three out of the Occident. In the Councell of Chalcedone were three
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:26266:53"/>hundred Biſhops, whereof, of the Occidentall Countreyes only foure, or fiue. In the ſecond generall Councell of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, an hundred ſixtie fiue Biſhops, and of theſe only ten or eleuen out of the Occident. Now albeit in the Occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall Empire there were many large Kingdomes and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces wherein Chriſtian Religion was profeſſed, yet theſe Councels (notwithſtanding the abſence of ſuch) ceaſſed not to be acknowledged as generall: or if this might be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed a iuſt cauſe to annull a Church Aſſembly, what a doore ſhould be opened to the Arrians, Macedonians, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians, Eutychians, to reiect the Decrees of theſe famous Countreyes, by the which their Hereſies were condemned? Laſtly, the obedience giuen by the Paſtors of theſe Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which you alledge to haue beene neglected, teſtifieth their conſent to the Acts, and that they haue ratified them for their owne parts.</p>

Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe no Moderatour was lawfully elected in this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, but the place vſurped by him, who had practiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the matter there proponed, and not as yet determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and conſequently who ought to haue beene ſecluded from any authoritie, in reſpect of the preiudice committed by him.</p>

               <p>In this, as in all the reſt almoſt of their exceptions againſt the Aſſembly, there is a falſe rule laid, whereby to try the lawfulneſſe thereof: To wit, the Acts and Cuſtome of the Church of Scotland vnder Presbyteriall Gouernment, which muſt not rule vs now, ſeeing the true forme of Church-gouernment now reſtored is much different from the eſtate of theſe times. It is true, that when the Church was gouerned by a paritie of Miniſters, they chooſed a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator by ſuffrage, though without any warrant or exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, eyther out of Scripture or Antiquitie, but being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled thereto of neceſſitie in regard of that forme of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, wherein no man had any ordinary prerogatiue aboue, or before others: but now the forme of Gouernment being altered, and each man knowing his owne roome and ſtation we are not tyed to obſerue that cuſtome, but ought rather to follow the Conſtitutions and practice of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, which was ruled by the ſame forme of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopall Gouernment that now is eſtabliſhed in this Land. And it is manifeſt, that euer, while the Pope of Rome did tyrannically arrogate vnto himſelfe and his Legats Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie in all Councels, this courſe was obſerued, that ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Chriſtian Prince himſelfe, when he was preſent, was Preſident, as <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great,

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:26266:54"/>of the Neſtorian Hereſie, which was there condemned. And if we looke through the whole Eccleſiaſticke Hiſtory, wee ſhall find this euer to haue beene the order; yea, in that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolike Councell, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. according to the iudgement of the moſt learned, both old and new Writers, the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> was there Preſident as Biſhop of Ieruſalem, <hi>Euſeb. li.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Theophil. in Act.</hi> 15. <hi>Lyranus ibidem, Dionyſius Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſianus, ibid.

And ſo is it probable out of the Text, becauſe hee pronounced the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in the concluſion of the action, which is the ſpeciall dutie of a Moderatour, and according to the words of his ſentence are the Synodicall Letters written to other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. This exception therefore of not lyting or electing a Moderator, being grounded vpon a Cuſtome or Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion now aboliſhed, in the place whereof hath ſucceded, the commendable order alwayes obſerued by the Primitiue Church in her pureſt times, is not to bee reſpected, and the example yee bring to qualifie this exception out of that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly at Perth, <hi>Anno</hi> 1596. is not only inſufficient to proue, but likewiſe in many points falſe.

Thirdly, it was called extraordinary, not for any exception taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Election of the Moderatour, but becauſe of the time and place, to wit, that the time and place appointed by the ſormer Aſſembly, was preuented vpon an extraordinary occaſion by his Maieſties miſſiue.

To this wee anſwer, firſt, The cauſe is different, for the queſtion to be debated in that Councell of Conſtantinople, was a ſubſtantiall point of Doctrine in it ſelfe, not ſubiect to his Imperiall power, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerted betwixt the Greeke and Latine Church, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

In which the Prince might by his owne authoritie impone a neceſſitie vpon all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to obey the ſame, except they could ſhew euident proofes out of the Scripture, that the ſame were abſolutely vnlawfull. And in caſe of diſobedience, hee might iuſtly threaten them by his authoritie. Yet all theſe particular ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and threatnings (which yee mention) with the wrath of Authoritie, impriſonment, exile, depriuation, &amp;c. were directed onely to ſuch, as without reaſon ſhould bee found obſtinate and refractarie, who, by reaſon ought not onely be threatned, but puniſhed. For if men will not regard au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, but doe as their conceit (which ſome falſly call con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience) leades them: if neither the Prince his command, nor acts of Synods, can bind them to obedience; may not theſe threatnings, yea, ought they not to bee vſed towards them, as it hath euer beene the practice in all Councels?

               <p>That this reiection of theſe difficulties, is a iuſt exception againſt the lawfulneſſe of this Aſſembly, yee proue it by the example of Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> who excepted againſt the ſecond Councell of Epheſus called <hi>Praedatorie,</hi> becauſe <hi>Dioſcorus</hi>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:26266:58"/>who was Preſident there, would not ſuffer the Synodal Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Weſt to be read in the Councell, I will anſwere firſt to your proofe, and then to the matter it ſelfe. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon yee vſe is captious, for yee reaſon from a partiall cauſe to a totall rejection. The Councell of Epheſus was iuſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected for diuers errours committed both in matter, and forme, yet yee chooſe onely one of the ſmalleſt, and applie it falſly to this Aſſembly. The errours in matter were, That firſt, it did approue hereticall doctrine, peruerting the grounds of our Faith. Next, it reſtored pernicious Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes alreadie condemned in a Councel at Conſtantinoplo, as <hi>Eutyches,</hi> and his followers; and condemned reuerend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for maintenance of the true doctrine, as <hi>Flautanus</hi> Archbiſhop of Conſtantinople, and others. The errours in the manner of proceeding were firſt, The Orthodoxe Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops beaten by the ſouldiers, (whom <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> had brought into the Councell) <hi>fuſtibus, &amp; gladijs,</hi> with ſwordes and ſtaues, whereby ſome dyed of their wounds receiued, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were bound with chaines, and others preſently carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to priſon. Secondly, the reſt that remained were forced to ſubſcribe a blanke paper, wherein <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> wrote, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer pleaſed him; theſe were the cauſes, why this Councell was called <hi>Praedatoria Synodus.</hi> It is true; The Pope of Rome alledged ſome other reaſons for the nullitie thereof, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was more offended, becauſe the ſame ſeemed dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue to his authoritie, as that the Synode was not conuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate by him, but by the Emperours commaund: His Legats were not admitted Moderators therein: And his Letters contayning his ſentence and opinion were not publiquely read, but ſuppreſt. Yee, leauing all the reſt of the weighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er cauſes, chop onely at this, as if therefore onely, this Councell was reiected: And to make this Aſſembly at Perth odious, compares it with that hereticall and turbulent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention, betwixt the which, there is no ſimilitude at all, no not in the poynt which yee chop at: For the Libell ye ſpeak of, was not peremptorily reiected, but a part of it being
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:26266:58"/>read, the reading was interrupted for two cauſes; firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it contained no new thing, but that which had beene alreadie heard, and ſufficiently anſwered to. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it contained ſome things, which could not but giue iuſt offence. The like was practiſed in that Councell vnder <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and <hi>Agatho,</hi> which yee alledged before for a patterne of orderly proceeding: In the eleuenth Seſſion ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we find that certaine Libells of <hi>Macarius,</hi> who oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himſelfe to the Councell, being preſented to bee read publiquely, after they had proceeded a while in reading, they reiected the reſt, for that they contayned ſo abſurd doctrine as would haue offended the eares of the hearers: And in the twelfth Seſſion, other Libels preſented by him, to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and offered by the Emperour to the Synod, after a part thereof was begun to bee read, the Councell finding that they contayned no new reaſons, but the ſame which had beene heard, and diſcuſſed before, they cauſed ſtay the reading thereof: So, in this Aſſembly, to reiect a Libell, fooliſh, and impertinent, could be no fault.</p>

As to the reading of his Maieſties Letter, dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the Aſſembly, which the Libeller notes to haue been foure times read, and immediately before the voting of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to moue the Aſſembly, I would aske him, What is the fault? The Aſſembly was called by his Maieſtie to giue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to the Articles proponed by himſelfe: His Letter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a Declaration of his pleaſure, and therewith diuers reaſons, why the Church ought to condeſcend to his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe deſires: Such as oppoſed them, inſiſted ſtill for a new continuation, and the delay of a long time. And it was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full they ſhould heare his Maieſties owne minde by his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who otherwiſe could not conſent vpon the anſwers twice giuen by his Highneſſe Commiſſioners in that poynt. If the Letter ſhould haue beene read at all the ſeuerall Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Aſſembly, there could be no fault in it, and I am ſure the time had beene better ſpent that way, then in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring many of their idle diſcourſes. For I thinke in that ſhort Letter, there be more good and ſolid ſtuffe, then is in all this long Libell of the Pamphleters; yet did it coſt him many houres, and (as we heare) many nights and daies to find out theſe particulars, at which he might carpe. But I know it is not the conſuming of time that troubles him: hee is ſorie, That the Aſſembly did regard the Letter ſo much, and was moued any way by it, as he ſpeakes. Now we tell him plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it was read to moue them to conſent, and it wrought that, for which it was done: If any fault be, it is this, Their humours, and purpoſes, were croſſed by the reading of the Letter, for we can ſee no more in it. Touching the terrours and threatnings breathed out by the Moderator of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, what they were, hath beene ſhewed in the Narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the proceedings; for the marking of the names of thoſe that ſhould be diſſenting, it is moſt falſe: They were war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:26266:59"/>to ſpeake in modeſtie, and abſtaine from intemperate words, ſuch as many of that ſort are giuen to, when reaſon failes them: And if they ſhould tranſgreſſe, warned of their danger. But, that it was threatned to delate the names of the voters, howſoeuer they ſhould giue their voyces, it is moſt vntrue. Yet is it nothing ſo vnuſuall, as he would make it appeare, in Councels and Synods to threaten and terrifie ſuch as are vnruly. In the firſt Councell of Chalcedon, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus</hi> the Emperour forbare not to threaten ſuch as ſhould ſhew themſelues refractary againſt the Decrees of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and amongſt the inſtructions giuen to his Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>Elpidius,</hi> and others, this is one, <hi>Si quem videritis contur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bationi &amp; tumultui ſtudentem, hunc cuſtodiae mancipate, &amp; ad noſtram perferte notitiam.</hi> Which in effect is, To marke their names, and to delate them to the Emperour. Many the like are to be obſerued in the Bookes of the Councels. And if ſuch ſpeeches may furniſh any exception for the nullitie of Councels &amp; Aſſemblies, we ſhal hardly find a lawful Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel or Aſſembly at all. As to the Sermons, and harrangues, wherewith he ſaid in his firſt exception, that the Aſſembly was preoccupied; I would gladly know, what Church Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly hath there euer beene kept withont Sermons and Harrangues? In the olde Councels they were not neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And if theſe be pre-occupations, how ſhall yee iuſtifie any Aſſembly kept from the beginning of our Church to this day? We haue heard by ſome of you at times, ſtrange Diſcourſes, and more ſtrange Sermons made at your Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, contayning bitter Inuectiues againſt his Maieſtie, the whole State, and ſometimes againſt the Miniſters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. And then was it your ordinarie cuſtome to ſet vp in Pulpit, not the wiſeſt, or moſt learned Preachers, by whom the reſt might haue beene inſtructed: but if there was any bold and impudent fellow that would not forbeare to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whatſoeuer was ſuggeſted to him in priuate, he was the man. And all that he ſpoke, was fathered vpon the holy Spirit. Theſe were your formes, in former times, worthie of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:26266:60"/>reproofe. And diuerſe of the Aſſemblies yee count to haue beene free and vncorrupt, if they were well tried, would for this cauſe be ſeene moſt worthy to be reiected.</p>

When the Church was gouerned by Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendents, theſe Commiſſions were not knowne; onely the Superintendents themſelues, becauſe of their place and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence, and ſuch of the Miniſters as they eſteemed wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to haue voyce in Aſſemblies, came thither: Now the Biſhops on whom lyes the burthen of the Church affaires, haue place by vertue of their callings to ſit, and giue voyce in Aſſemblies; and Miniſters by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion from their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and Dioceſſes, becauſe all cannot bee preſent, nor may the Pariſhes in the Country bee left deſtitute of their Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers at once.

The practice of theſe famous Monarchs and Kings, who were in their times nurſing Fathers of the Church, ſhewes that Princes are not tyed to any number of Commiſſioners, but as it ſeemes good to them, or as the buſineſſe in hand requires, ſo they doe: Thus in the Councell of Chalcedon, where <hi>Conſtantinus Pogonatus</hi> (whom yee alleadged before for example of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable proceeding) was preſent and Preſident, there ſate with him other thirteene Iudges and Senators, whoſe names are there expreſſed.

Likewiſe in the eight Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall Councell of Spaine, holden in Toledo, <hi>Anno</hi> 653. there ſate and ſubſcribed ſixteene Dukes and Earles. In the twelft Nationall Councell of Toledo, <hi>Anno</hi> 681. conuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate by <hi>Eringius</hi> King of Spaine, together with the Biſhops did ſit the King himſelfe, and <hi>vniuerſi Seniores Palatij,</hi> The
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:26266:62"/>Ancients or Senators of the Court, fifteene in number; of whom, in his ſpeech to the Councell, hee ſayes; <hi>Quos intereſſe huic Concilio, delegit nostra ſublimitas.</hi> In the thirteenth Councell of Toledo, there ſate, and ſubſcribed ſixe and twentie Dukes and Earles. In the fifteenth Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell thereof, there ſate, and ſubſcribed ſeuenteene Earles.

And looke wee to the cuſtome of our owne Church; many Counſellours and Noble men haue had vote in Aſſemblies in name of his Maieſtie. In the Aſſembly holden at Edinburgh, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 1563. <hi>Decemb.</hi> 25. beſides the Superintendents, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and Commiſſioners of the Churches, and Prouinces, there were preſent nine Lords of the Counſaile, Earles and Barons; and becauſe thereafter, the Regent, his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile, and Nobilitie, did not aſſiſt the Aſſemblies ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently as before, an earneſt Petition was made by the whole Aſſembly conuened in Edinburgh, <hi>Anno</hi> 1573. <hi>March</hi> 6. to the Regent his Counſaile, and Nobilitie, to giue their preſence and concurrence with the Church in their proceedings, becauſe ſuch had beene the practice in Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies from the beginning of the reformation.

               <p>At Saint-<hi>Andrewes,</hi> in <hi>April</hi> 1582.

The which Aſſembly, neyther tho Church then did, nor will the Biſhops now ſtand to; neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe in this Aſſembly, ſome Moderators of Presbyteries voted without Election, and only by vertue of the forged clauſes of the Act fore ſaid: if any Presbytery directed their Moderators in Commiſſion vpon ignorance and errour, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing reſpect to the fore-ſaid clauſes afore-ſaid, their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and errour is no lawfull conſent. It is in the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:26266:65"/>to be remembred, that the preſent Moderators are not of the qualitie of theſe conſtant Moderators, but of a new Edition ſet out at Glaſgow, <hi>viz.</hi> they are the Biſhops De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, placed by them in Presbyteries.</p>

               <p>This reaſon will not inferre a nullity: Presbyteries (yee ſay) were not aſtricted by the Act of Aſſembly at Saint-<hi>Andrewes,</hi> 1582. to ſend their Moderators in Commiſſion; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Moderators ought not to haue come, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of their Commiſſions from the Presbyteries: there is no conſequence heere: for it is, as if I would reaſon, The Presbytery of Saint-<hi>Andrewes</hi> was not aſtricted to haue ſent Maſter <hi>Iohn Carmichael</hi> to the Aſſembly. Therefore he ought not to haue had voice therein, notwithſtanding of his Commiſſion, Any man ſees the inconſequence. But here yee adde foure things. Firſt, that the Act of Linlythguow, 1606 bearing, that conſtant Moderatours ſhould bee conſtant members of the generall Aſſembly, was forged. Next, that the Biſhops will not ſtand to this Aſſembly now, more then the Church did at that time. Thirdly, that ſome Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours came to this Aſſembly without Election, by vertue of the ſaid Act, and the Prebyteries that directed them, did the ſame vpon ignorance, and errour, which is not a lawfull conſent. Fourthly, that the preſent Moderatours, are not of the quality of theſe conſtant Moderatours; but of a new E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſet out at Glaſgow, <hi>viz.</hi> the Biſhops Depuries in Presbyteries. I anſwere to the firſt, that there is no truſt to be giuen to you in this buſineſſe, wherin I haue better reaſon to be beleeued, ſpeaking for worthy and reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d men, whoſe ſame was neuer blotted: then ſuch an one as you are, that did not feare to deny the authority of our Souereigne Prince in his owne preſence, and immediately after for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare it to the Brethren. Maſter <hi>Iames Nicolſone</hi> now with God, did moderate that Aſſembly at Linlythguow, a man for his Wiſdome, Knowledge, and Holineſſe in greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, then that thy calumnies can touch him. All the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:26266:65"/>concluſions thereof were penned by himſelfe, at leaſt by his aduice; and to haue made a greater aduantage, then that concluſion could bring with it, would not haue altered a ſillable in any Act, nor forged or foyſted in any clauſe, as thou ſpeakeſt. The Scribe of that Aſſembly was Doctour <hi>Henry Philip,</hi> yet Miniſter at Arbrothe, whoſe truth and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, to ſpeake nothing of his Learning, Prudence, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gifts, is as well knowne, as is thy perfidle and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous rebellions, for which now thou liueſt in Exile. And if thy ſayings, or the ſpeeches of the like of thee, might call ſuch mens honeſtie in queſtion, it ſhould not goe well. If I ſeeme more bitter, in this Anſwere, to the Reader, then I am accuſtomed, let him conſider, that he who neither ſpares dead, nor liuing, great, nor ſmall, muſt bee anſwered ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as he deſerues. Now where yee ſay, that the Biſhops will not ſtand to that Aſſembly now, more then the Church then did, I doe not conceiue, whom ye call the Church: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye thinke a handfull of mutinous perſons, ſuch as your ſelfe, to be the Church: otherwiſe the Miniſters generally in all the parts of the Countrey did conſent and obey the Acts of that Aſſembly. And what if the concluſions taken there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in yet ſtands, vnrepealed by other Aſſemblies that haue fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed? the Biſhops doe all acknowledge and ſtand to. For it is the Law of the Church, that rules them in matters of outward policie, and all other peaceable Miniſters: yee, and the like of you ſtand to no Law, but the will of your owne minds. Thirdly, where ye ſay, that ſome Moderatours were ſent Commiſſioners by the Presbyteries vpon an ignorant conceit, that they were bound by the Act of Linlythguow ſo to doe, ye qualifie no part of this by any particulars, and if ye did it would be replyed, that in euery co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uention, that is permitted for exerciſe through the Land, the fitteſt and choyſeſt of a number is appointed to moderate: And that whether the moderation lay vpon them, or not; their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren would haue elected them, and no others to haue bin Commiſſioners to that Aſſembly. Laſtly, where ye tell vs,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:26266:66"/>ſcoffingly, that the preſent Moderators are of a new edition, to wit, the deputies of Biſhops, yee muſt know, That your changeable Moderators, were of that new edition yee ſpeake of; for in no age was it ſeene euer before this, that indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently euery man was taken in his courſe, to rule and preſide without conſideration had of his gifts and qualities. And theſe we haue now, are ſuch as the Chriſtian Church euer had, &amp; vſed to keepe order in their meetings, &amp; conuentions.</p>

               <p>It hath beene ſufficiently proued, that there was neyther Nobleman, Baron, Burgeſſe, nor Biſhop, but had as good warrant to vote, as any of the negatiues, &amp; therefore ſhould not be ſubſtracted from the number of the affirmatiue vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. This yee perceiue, and flie to another ſhift, according to your cuſtome. Yee graunt your number were fewer, for ſo they were by more then another halfe: but their weight, yee ſay, was greater: for with them, as ye alledge, there was three great ouer weights in the ballance. Firſt, they had no feare. Secondly, they were not ouercome with perſwaſion: And the third, they adhered to the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Church. It is true indeed, that neither the feare of inconueniencies, and euills which might haue enſued to the great hurt of the Church, and hinderance of the Goſpel, did moue them; nor could reaſon, whereby the change was manifeſtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued both lawfull, and expedient perſwade them, but to the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:26266:66"/>iudgement of the Church (as ye call it) they adhered, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard of good or euill, without reſpect to right or wrong. And this is the Idoll which they ſtill adore. Now let vs conſider this iudgement whereunto they adhered. The iudgement of our Church touching cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and circumſtances to bee vſed in the worſhippe of God, is two-fold. There is one, that is particular: the other is generall. The particular iudgement determineth and defineth what ceremonies in particular the Reformers thought expedient to be receyued, and reiected. The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall declares, what the Church, and euery Chriſtian ſhould eſteeme, beleeue, and hold touching the particular order and policie which is ſet downe for the vſe of ceremonies and circumſtances to be obſerued in the worſhip of God. The former iudgement is expreſſed in the firſt Booke of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and ſome few Acts of the generall Aſſemblies cited afterward by your ſelfe. This other we haue in the one and twentieth Article of the Confeſsion of Faith, about the end thereof, and in the ſeuenth Chapter of the ſecond Booke of Diſcipline; both which are afterwards cited in the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Diſcourſe, where yee profeſſe your ſelfe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſe the oath. And it is that iudgement whereunto the Swearers did oblige themſelues by their oath. In this it is declared expreſly, That no order, nor policie in ceremonies can be eſtabliſhed for all times, ages, and places, but that it is temporall, and may and ſhould be changed, when neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie require. This is the generall and conſtant iudgement of the Church, whereunto the negatiue Voters were bound, by their oath to haue adhered, which they did not. That o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whereunto they adhered (as yee alledge) is onely tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, and ſubiect to change, according to the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and occaſions of times, places, and perſons: For if by occaſion of any of theſe circumſtances, the obſeruation, which was profitable at one time, become hurtfull at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that which ſerued for reformation, breedes and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, profaneneſſe, or ſuperſtition; it is the conſtant
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:26266:67"/>and generall iudgement of the Church, that it ſhould bee changed, and altered, which formerly was obſerued. And to apply this to the purpoſe in hand: It is notoriouſly knowne, That ſitting at the Communion, which at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation was iudged moſt conuenient to aboliſh the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of tranſubſtantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; bread-worſhip, makes the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament now to be contemned, and profaned by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort of Profeſſours: That the want of diuine exerciſe on the fiue holy-dayes, hath almoſt buried in obliuion the ineſtimable benefits of our redemption; the ſuperſtitious obſeruation of theſe times not the leſſe continuing ſtill in our Church: That the withholding of Baptiſme from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants in times of neceſſitie, and the holy Supper from others at the houre of their dying, hath beene the griefe of many good Chriſtians. Laſtly, that great ignorance is crept into the Church, by the neglect of the catechiſing of young chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and for lacke of a particular tri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll of their profiting in knowledge, at the V ſitations of Churches. And vpon theſe, and the like conſiderations, who ſees not, that altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in theſe poynts was expedient? Adde to this, our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie with the greater part of the reformed Churches, which is to be prefered much, to the ſingularitie of any priuat opinion, or cuſtome of perſons, and Churches. Then the ſhewing of an vnneceſſarie, vndutifull, and vnchriſtian op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and contradiction to the moſt religious Prince on earth, who for the glorie of God, and the edification of his Church, did vrge this alteration. In this, if his Maieſtie had beene gain-ſtand without right, or reaſon, what euils and inconueniencies might haue enſued, it is not eaſie to ſay. Ye afterwards call it a matter vncertaine, and depending vpon Gods prouidence; but wee are not to prie in theſe ſecrets, and ought to follow his reuealed will, who hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vs to feare him, and obey the King. This obedience ſhould euer be performed, where it may ſtand with the feare of God Theſe things haue not beene conſidered by the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue voters: And euidently ſhew that their pretext of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:26266:67"/>adhering to the particular iudgement of the Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto in ſuch caſes they ought not to haue adhered, is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but a faire excuſe, and ſpacious vaile to couer their wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full oppoſition to his Maieſties will, and the well of the Church, which in the eſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of euery prudent and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Chriſtian muſt eleuate the authoritie of all their voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and make the ſame of no weight.</p>

               <p>That he may be ſcene a perfit man in the art of Calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, hee heapes tenne calumnies together in one Section, whereunto in the order they are proponed, I anſwer; firſt he ſayes, the affirmatiue voters had their Commiſſions procured by their Biſhops. This is ſo falſe, as nothing can be more vntruely ſaid: for all the Biſhops in their Synods kept before that Aſſembly, hauing acquainted the Miniſters that a ſupplication would be ſent to his Maieſtie, for libertie to conuene a generall Aſſembly, and exponed the neceſſitie of their admitting the Articles, warned them to chuſe the moſt wiſe, learned, and peaceable of their number, to bee their Commiſſioners, if ſo the libertie craued were obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:26266:68"/>but left the perſons to be named by themſelues, in their meetings at their Exerciſes: vpon which aduertiſement, it is true, That certaine of your factious ſort employed all their meanes to procure Commiſſion to themſelues, and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as they knew would be of their minde; and preuayled ſo farre, as verie few of the Miniſtrie poſſeſſed with your humor were abſent from the Aſſembly. And to manifeſt your falſhood in this particular: It is notoriouſly knowne, that at S. Andrewes, one day beeing appoynted for chuſing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of that Exerciſe, the whole number of Miniſters conuened; albeit neither before that time, theſe tenne or twelue yeares paſt, nor ſince, diuers of them were euer ſeene, eyther at Exerciſe, or Synods. Notice whereof being giuen to the Archbiſhop of S. Andrewes, who was at that time in the Citie, by certaine that feared a trouble might fall out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them in the nomination, he comes himſelfe to their meeting, and declared, how hee, and all that were preſent, perceiued they were come that day onely, by pluralitie of voyces, to chuſe their Commiſſioners. And howbeit they might iuſtly be excluded from bearing Commiſſion, or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing any voice in the choyce of them that ſhould bee ſent, who at other times vouchſafed not their preſence to the Brethren, leſt it ſhould be ſaid afterwards that the choyce of their Commiſſioners were not free, he willed them to name whom they thought meeteſt. And his owne voyce beeing firſt defired, he named for two, Maiſter <hi>Iohn Carmichaell,</hi> and Maiſter <hi>Alexander Henryſone,</hi> whom hee knew to bee ſet both of them againſt the Articles, that they might haue place to reaſon, and giue voyce in the Aſſembly. So farre hee was from plotting and preparing voyces to beare forth that buſineſſe. And as he vttered in the Aſſembly, at diuers times vpon occaſion ſince, wee haue heard him ſolemnely proteſt, that he did neuer open his mouth to ſolicite or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade any to ſtand for receyuing the Articles; but left euery man to his owne iudgement, to doe, and ſay, as hee ſhoud finde the force of reaſon to moue him. And yet had it beene
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:26266:68"/>ſo, that the Biſhops had named them, and procured their Commiſſion, there ſhould nothing haue beene done, againſt the cuſtome of the primitiue Church: for no Presbyters were euer admitted to ſit in Councels, except they had been authoriſed by their Biſhops, as we ſhewed before. And du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſpace of many yeares after our reformation, while the Superinte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dents ruled Church affaires, no Miniſter might come to the generall Aſſembly, except they had choſen and named him, as was qualified before out of their owne Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. This is our reply to the firſt.</p>
               <p>The ſecond calumnie is, That the affirmatiue Voters were mercenarie Penſioners: If hee had ſet downe their names, and ſhewed, whoſe Penſioners they were, wee ſhould haue eaſily ſhewed, that though they were Penſioners, yet they were not mercenarie men. One may ſafely enioy a benefice conferred vpon him by his Prince, or ſome noble Perſonage in regard of his former ſeruices, yet be no mercenarie. And they may be mercenaries who enioy no penſion at all; for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the diſpoſition of a man wil make him iuſtly to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch: Neither to my knowledge was there in that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly any one that had penſion of his Maieſtie, Maiſter <hi>Patrick Galloway</hi> excepted, whom before yee ſcoffingly ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a man of many penſions. But ye are not I hope ſo farre paſt ſhame, as to ſay, that hee enioyes any of his penſions, how few, or many ſo euer they be, vpon paction, or promiſe to be yeelding vnto euerie thing, that his Maieſtie ſhould be pleaſed to propone to the Church: yea it is knowne, that in theſe ſame matters he alone did more then ye all, to haue diuerted his Maieſtie by humble aduiſe and perſwaſion from vrging them further: And tooke the boldneſſe to propone his reaſons in writing, againſt the Feſtiuities, and the Article of kneeling: which his Maieſtie was graciouſly pleaſed to Anſwer by himſelfe for his better ſatisfaction. Theſe fiue and fortie yeares, or aboue, he hath liued a Miniſter in the Church of Scotland, and was his Maieſties owne Chaplaine, during the moſt of that time. And for his labours and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:26266:69"/>trauels taken for the benefit of the Church, deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued better reward, then all the penſions hee enioyes. But when this age is gone, his iuſt praiſe in deſpight of you all ſhall continue with the poſteritie. If I pleaſed, I could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that the chiefe of your Sect hath a penſion of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, of greater worth then all his put together, and enioyes it with preiudice of many poore Miniſters; and for no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite at all, except it be merite to worke his Maieſtie perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vexation, and keepe the Church with his conceits in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall trouble. And I could tell you in a word, that it is more fitting to be his Maieſties penſioner, then the penſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of any Burgeſſes wife, or Ladie in the Countrey, ſuch as many of you are; and were not your purſes filled by this meanes, we ſhould not be troubled with your vnrulineſſe. Theſe things you muſt patiently heare, for they are truths, ſeeing yee forbeare not to lye of men more worthie, beyond all compariſon, then is your ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Your third calumnie is, That they were Platſeruers for augmentation of ſtipends: this is an euident vntruth. The Commiſſion for ſtipends expired in the Moneth of Iuly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Aſſembly, and further hope of augmentation they could not haue: where yee ſhall ſuffer this to be told you, that the negatiue voters had greater benefit by that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, then the affirmatiue: And that according to your manner, you gaue good attendance all that time, and many hopes of good behauiour, till your buſineſſe was effected: Howbeit ſince, diuers of your haue turned your Cloakes, as wee vſe to ſay; Albeit the benefit is not loſt, for it was not to you done, or for any of you, but to the Churches, at which ye preſently ſerue.</p>
               <p>Ye ſay fourthly, That they were gapers for promotion: But how doe you know that? Who made you a Iudge of your Brethren? Is this pietie to iudge of mens hearts and affections at your pleaſure? None of you (forſooth) like to haue promotions, and I warrant you would flie into deſerts to hide your ſelues, if ye knew your ſelues to be ſought to be
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:26266:69"/>placed in high roomes: but what meanes then your conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall reſort in the chiefe Townes, with the neglect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of your owne cures at home? Yee profeſſe not to loue the World, yet none followes it ſo much. Ye may not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure domination, yet will play the Lords ouer Kings, and the conſciences of euery man; and think while as ye declame againſt ambition, wealth, and worldly honour, that yee are not perceyued euen then, and by that meane, chiefly to hunt after theſe things.</p>
               <p>Ye ſay fiftly, That they were of ſuſpect credite; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it well, with you, they were ſo: Nay, yee might ſay more, ye ſuſpected they were Reprobates; for it is a thing familiar to your Sect, to pronounce of mens ſaluation, and condemnation, as they fancie. And yet that Booke, which they ſay ſome of you haue made vp, to note therein, the names of the holy Societie, is not the Booke of Life. The credite of that Regiſter is not committed vnto you.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, They had ſubſcribed, ye ſay, other priuate Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, more dangerous then the preſent: I conceiue your meaning to be, of the Articles offered vnto them, that enter in the Miniſtrie: If yee haue not ſeene them, ye ſhall know, that theſe Articles bind ſuch as enter, to the obedience of the preſent diſcipline, and of all, and whatſomeuer acts, and conſtitutions, that ſhall be lawfully made hereafter by the Church, in matters of outward policie, and order: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I will not ſay, the falſhood, but the inconſtancie of ſome of your number, gaue the occaſion, who after they had promiſed to liue peaceable, and obedient to the Church, within a few dayes, hauing gotten what they ſought for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more turbulent and vnquiet then any.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, They had beene threatned, you ſay, priuately, with depoſition by their owne Dioceſian Biſhops. And wil ye qualifie this of any one perſon, wee ſhall grant all your informalities. But this is ſo vntrue, as yee neuer ſhall bee able to doe it.</p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:26266:70"/>
               <p>Eightly, They were not well informed in their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for lacke, yee ſay, of full and free reaſoning. Here ye conſtrue other men by your ſelfe, and ſome of your ſide; who being asked the reaſon of their negatiue voyce, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, That they had neuer ſtudied the queſtion well, yet that they followed the example of learned and godly men, with whom they had rather erre ignorantly, then follow the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops with ſome ſhew of reaſon. And one of your negatiue Voters profeſſed publiquely in the Aſſembly, That he ſaw no euident reaſon againſt the lawfulneſſe of the Articles, yet he would refuſe them, becauſe his deceaſſed father did miſlike them. Theſe were the beſt informations that the moſt of your negatiues had; as to the affirmatiue Voters, when yee, or any man ſhall aske them, they will giue reaſon ſufficient for their iudgement.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, they were circumuented with promiſes, yee ſay, made to them by their Biſhops, that they ſhould not be vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the practice, if they would only conſent to make an act, to pleaſe the King. But you ſhould haue named the Biſhops that made ſuch promiſes, for your ſaying deſerues not that credit. It is true, that when fome of you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the matters to be lawfull in themſelues, complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned only of precipitation, and that time was not giuen them to reſolue, it was anſwered by ſome in priuate, That if they would ceaſſe from their buſineſſe, and profeſſe ſo much in publike, which in conference they acknowledged of the lawfulneſſe of the Articles, time ſhould bee granted vnto them, before the practice were vrged. But this they obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not, and did to the contrary what they could; and this I hope was no circumuention of any man, nor were any of the affirmatiue voters carryed by theſe promiſes: for what they voted vnto without any ſcruple, they haue ſince that time practiſed. Your tenth and laſt calumny, that they were ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with publike threatnings, hath been anſwered before. And now when ye deſire your Reader to iudge, whether the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:26266:70"/>voices ſhould be pondered, or numbered; I truſt it hath not appeared by any of your alleadged motiues, that there is ſuch cauſe; on the other ſide, if your negatiue voters had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualled the affirmatiue in number, they might haue beene iuſtly reiected; firſt, for the open preiudice they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in preaching, and publike condemning the Articles that they knew were to be reaſoned, as impious, Papiſtical, and Idolatrous. I know yee will oppoſe to this, the preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice you mentioned before, committed by the affirmatiue voters in the practice of the Ceremonies before they were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed. But what they did in this, was by the aduice of the chiefe Miniſters in the Kingdome, without condemning the former practice of the Church, and vnder proteſtation, that if the Church did not find the Articles fit to bee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, their practice ſhould not tye them in after-times, ſeeing they acknowledged the indifferencie of all theſe matters. Next, the chiefe reaſons which your negatiue voters gaue at any time, were, the hazard of their credits amongſt their flockes, and of feare to be reputed inconſtant, if they ſhould yeeld at the ſudden to that, which they had ſo openly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned: and what are their reaſons being well ſifted, but reaſons of ſelfe-loue, and a care to maintaine your popular eſtimation, which is nothing ſo much to bee regarded, as is his Maieſties ſatisfaction? Therfore to end this purpoſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye regard the weight, or the number of voyces, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatiues were ſuperior in both.</p>

               <p>This Libeller being now to conclude the Nullity, which he intended to proue, paines himſelfe to mooue the People, Miniſters, Profeſſors, and all to diſobedience of the Acts concluded: and where the authority of the Aſſembly, might draw men to condeſcend, hee labours to ſhew them, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the iudgement of the lawfulneſſe of Aſſemblies in ſome ſort doth belong to euery Chriſtian; which if it ſhould not,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:26266:72"/>he laies downe certaine inconueniences; that thereby might grow vpon them all; to which I anſwere, that this Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly being conuocated, in the Name of God, aſſiſted in the proceedings thereof by his bleſſed Spirit, and all the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities obiected being now ſufficiently cleered, we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded euery true Chriſtian whether he be Miniſter, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, will ſubmit his iudgement and affections both, to the concluſions taken therein. And if any will ſtill oppoſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues thereto, we doubt not to cal them troublers of the Eſtate, ſeditious Perſons, Schiſmatickes, louers of Diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and direct Enemies to the Weale, and peace both of the Church, and Kingdome. That ye would bee called ſuch men, ye might well propheſie, ſeeing ye be priuy to your owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions; but where ye adiect that <hi>account must be made one day of ſuch contumelies and reproches,</hi> I would but aske you, whether yee doe thinke to paſſe free in the Day of that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and not be brought to your anſwere, for calling the Seruants of Chriſt, mercenarie men, and thereby implying his Maieſtie, your Souereigne to be another <hi>Balak</hi> in giuing the wages of iniquitie, to hirelings: for condemning all, that are obedient to the voyce of the Church in theſe matters, as men periured, and without all conſcience, and diuers others your malicious ſpeeches, vttered in this Pamphlet: or if you thinke it no fault to make a rent in the body of Chriſt, which is his Church, which it appeares euidently ye are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about; the anſweres following will cleere to all men, that the eſtate of our Church is no way preiudged by any Act concluded in the Aſſembly at Perth, and that the obedience thereof, will not inferre a defection from our former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. But that diſtinction of two-fold iudgement ſerues little to this purpoſe: for howbeit lawfully euery man may inquire of things concluded, and for his owne information ſeeke out the grounds and warrants thereof, yet whither ſoeuer his iudgement incline, hee muſt render himſelfe obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the Conſtitutions of the Church in which he liues.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:26266:72"/>And there is a great difference betweene decerning and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning, though eyther yee or your Printer hath miſtaken it; for it belongeth to the Iudge to decerne, and Chriſtians, as ye ſay, euen in their priuate callings may diſcerne, but this their diſcerning will neuer free them from the ſubiection of Lawes impoſed eſpecially in matters of this nature, for wee are now vpon order, and policie onely. And except ye could ſhew ſome euident place out of the Word, or bring a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie demonſtration to warrant your contrarie iudgement, your diſobedience will euer be faultie. The authoritie of the Church muſt yeeld to the written Word, but the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of priuate men, to the authoritie of the Church.

               <p>The Libeller hath forgotten to exclude Confirmation, but ſince it is vnderſtood, wee anſwere to the reſt. Firſt, That the ſolemne miniſtration of the Sacraments appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Church, eſpecially, the act of the aſſembly holden at Edinburgh, <hi>Anno</hi> 1581. which forbiddeth the miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof in priuate houſes, excludes not the miniſtration thereof in priuate places, when as neceſſitie vrges; caſes of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:26266:84"/>neceſſitie being euer eſteemed as excepted from all ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie rules of policie, in which the ſame is not expreſſed. Secondly, The obſeruation of the Lords day was ſo appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as it did not exclude any of the Holy dayes now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to be obſerued, except Chriſtmas only: and this our Church excluded not ſimply, but only ſo farre as it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed vpon the conſciences of men, to bee obſerued as a part of diuine worſhip, without warrant of the Word: as it is expreſly declared in the firſt booke of Diſcipline, pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Maſter <hi>Iohn Knox, anno</hi> 1560. both in the explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the firſt head touching doctrine, and the ſecond tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Sacraments. Thirdly, Sitting at the Table, in the act of receiuing the Sacrament, was neuer eſteemed by our Church, either as a neceſſary point of doctrine, or diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, which might not be altered, but onely in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Reformers held to be moſt conuenient.

And as for your 59. yeares practiſe, it cannot change the uature of things indifferent, and make theſe formes and circumſtances, which are of themſelues alterable, become neceſſary and vnchangeable: yea, by the contrary, the preſcription of a long time giues iuſt cauſe often of alteration, becauſe either the things practiſed, which at the beginning were profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, become hurtfull, or that which was conuenient in the time preceding, becommeth inconuenient: or becauſe the ſame things are abuſed to ſuperſlition and prophaneneſſe; or becauſe an opinion is bred, by long cuſtome, of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:26266:85"/>deuiſed) are but temporall, ſo may and ought they to bee changed, when they rather foſter ſuperſtition, then that they ediſie the Church vſing the ſame.</hi> Likewiſe in the ſeuenth chapter of the ſecond booke of Diſcipline, regiſtred amongſt the acts of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Aſſembly, <hi>anno</hi> 1581. we haue two concluſions to the ſame purpoſe, ſet downe in theſe words: <hi>The finall end of all Aſſemblies, is firſt to keepe the Religion and Doctrine in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, without error and corruption: Next, to keepe comlineſſe, and good order in the Church. For this orders cauſe, they may make cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine rules and conſtitutions, pertaining to the good behaniour of all the members of the Church in their vocation. Secondly, they haue power alſo to abrogate and aboliſh all ſtatutes and ordinances, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Eccleſiaſticall matters that are found noyſome, or vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, or agree not with the time, or are abuſed by the people.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is euident; that ſeeing the matters controuerted, are but matters of circumſtance, forme, and ceremony, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſhall be proued, that neither the Church in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, nor any member thereof in particular, did, or might lawfully binde themſelues by oath, ſubſeription, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obligation, not to change or alter their practiſe and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes touching theſe things: for all they that ſubſcribe the Conſeſſion of faith, and the ſecond booke of Diſcipline, did ſweare, that they thought theſe things ſhould and might be altered when neceſſitie required.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:26266:85"/>and looſe the ſaid Oath, in any caſe aforeſaid?</p>

               <p>The former iudgement of our Church, whereunto wee did binde our ſelues by our oathes was, that no policie, nor order in ceremonies could be appointed for all ages, times, and places; and that the ſame might, and ought to bee changed vpon great cauſes, and weightie reaſons, as is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident by the former anſwere. To this iudgement of the Church, the Aſſembly at Perth adhered, and according thereto altered ſome cuſtomes, touching circumſtantiall ceremonies formerly vſed in the Church, vpon good and great reaſons: neither did that Aſſembly looſe the ſaid Oath, or diſpenſe with it in any ſort, but hath confirmed it by their owne practiſe. Wherefore I anſwere, That euery Preacher and Profeſſor in our Church, ſhould ſtand to the former iudgement thereof, whereunto he bound himſelfe by his Oath, when he did ſweare to the Confeſſion of faith, and that no power can compel the alteration of iudgement, or looſe the ſaid Oath in any caſe. And that he who ſware, <hi>That he did thinke that no policie, and order in ceremonies can be appointed for all ages, times, and places, but that the ſame may, and ought to be changed, when neceſſitie requires;</hi> Did neuer, nor could ſweare without breach of this Oath, that the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie of ſitting at the receiuing of the Sacrament (eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by our Church, at the reformation, moſt conuenient, but not neceſſarie) could bee appointed for all ages, times, and places; and that it might not, nor ought to bee altered in any caſe: by the contrary all who ſwore to the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of faith, did ſweare, That the policie, and order of ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the Sacrament was ſuch, as could not be appointed for all ages, times, and places, and that it might, and ſhould be changed, when it did not ſo much edifie the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in pietie, as foſter prophaneneſſe and ſuperſtition. And this ſitting foſters in all theſo that practiſe it, with a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious conceit and opinion, that the ſame was inſtituted
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:26266:86"/>by our Sauiour as a point of diuine worſhip, and by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary practiſe commended to the Church, for an eſſential or integrant part of the Sacrament, which yee maintaine in this Pamphlet.</p>
               <p>Now leauing this to bee conſidered by ſuch as are not partially affected, but loue the truth, and hate contention: I proceed to the Oath, which yee conſider firſt in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, takers of the ſame: Secondly, in the matter whereto they ſweare: Thirdly, in the forme and manner, whereby they are bound: And fourthly, by the force and effect of that forme, for making ſure mens particular deeds. Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the perſons, yee ſay this.</p>

               <p>The Perſons, takers of the Oath, are Chriſtians come to perfect yeares, and free perſons, who did not only know in generall the doctrine and diſcipline, whereto they bound themſelues by their oath, but in particular the points con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerted, as followeth: Firſt, That in the yeare of God, 1581. it was concluded, that the Sacraments ſhould be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely miniſtred, and not in priuate houſes: Secondly, That in the yeare 1560, it was declared by the Church, that Chriſt ſate with his Diſciples at Table, when hee inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the Supper, and that ſitting at Table was the moſt conuenient geſture to this holy action: Thirdly, That Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation was to be abhorred, as one of the Popes fiue ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard Sacraments: Fourthly, That the keeping of Holy dayes, ſuch as the Feaſt of Chriſtmas, impoſed vpon the conſciences of men, without warrant of Gods word, was condemned by preaching, and corrected by publique cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Church.</p>

               <p>I will not anſwere you, as iuſtly I might, that the firſt booke of Diſcipline, whereby the moſt of theſe conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are warranted, was neuer knowne to our common Profeſſors, nor acknowledged by our Church, to haue the authoritie of Eccleſiaſticall Canons: but I ſay, The Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:26266:86"/>at Perth hath decreed nothing to the contrary thereof. For firſt, Touching the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, we fully agree to the ordinance made <hi>anno</hi> 1581, to wit, That the Sacraments ſhould bee ſolemnely miniſtred, and not in priuate houſes: The occaſion of making this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was a miſorder that fell out in the perſons of two Miniſters, namely, Maſter <hi>Alexander Mure,</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Falkland,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Alexander Forreſter,</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,</hi> as is cleare by the narratiue of the act, which is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue only to the celebration of Mariage, and the miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacraments, <hi>extra caſum neceſſitatis,</hi> where, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any vrgent neceſſitie order may be kept. But our que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, whether in extraordinary caſes the Sacraments may be miniſtred extraordinarily in priuate houſes, as they were in the Primitiue Church by the Apoſtles, and in the beginning of the reformation, by the Preachers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell? In theſe and the like caſes, there is no act of any Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, that determines what ſhould bee done. Therefore put the caſe, our Church had ſworne and ſubſcribed that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, yet hath ſhee done nothing contrary to her oath, either by making, or obeying the acts concluded at Perth, which doe only reſpect the caſes of neceſſitie.</p>
               <p>So, whether to ſit at a Table in receiuing the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was moſt conuenient, according as our Church eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at the time of reformation, is not the queſtion: but whether to ſit at a Table be neceſſary, as inſtituted and left by our Sauiours example to be obſerued, and that without breach of the inſtitution, the ſame may not be altered? This queſtion was neuer defined by any Canon of our Church: Therefore put the caſe, that our Church had ſworne and ſubſcribed, That to ſit at the Communion was moſt conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, according to the iudgement of our firſt Reformers: yet, we haue done nothing contrarie to that oath, by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing ſitting with kneeling, becauſe kneeling at this time is found to be the more conuenient geſture: for that which at one time is more conuenient, may bee leſſe conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:26266:87"/>at another. As to our Sauiours ſitting (if ſo be he ſate, <hi>nam adhuc ſub iudice lis eſt)</hi> it was not exemplary, or appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be followed of vs, as ſhall be afterwards proued; and his practiſe did only declare, that ſitting might be lawfully vſed, not, that of neceſſitie it muſt be vſed, and cannot bee altered, when the Church findes the change expedient.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whether Confirmation, as it was abuſed in Popery for a Sacrament, ſhould be re-induced, is not the queſtion, for that is condemned in the very narratiue of the act made at Perth. But, whether the Biſhop in his Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ought to trie the education of yong children in the grounds of Religion, as in the firſt booke of Diſcipline the Superintendent was ordained to doe, whereof yee may reade in the fift head touching the office of Superintendents. Therefore put the caſe our Church had ſworne, and ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed all the heads and Conſtitutions of the foreſaid booke, yet by the act made at <hi>Perth,</hi> ſhee hath not violated her oath, by appointing Biſhops in their Viſitations to take this triall. For they are now the Superintendents of the Church.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Wee contend not, whether the obſeruation of Holy dayes, as that of Chriſtmas, ſhould be impoſed vpon the conſcience, which in the explication of the firſt head of the foreſaid booke of Diſcipline is condemned, as alſo in the firſt words of the act made at <hi>Perth,</hi> touching the fiue dayes: but the queſtion is, whether the Church may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the commemoration of Chriſts ineſtimable benefits vpon the ſaid dayes, as all the reformed Churches doe, and our Diuines hold to bee lawfull. Of this our Church neuer defined any thing. Therfore the making &amp; obſeruing of the act touching this point, is not againſt her former oath. And to conclude, The Subſcribers and Swearers vnto our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Diſcipline, know no Canon nor conſtitution of the Church made in former times, that is contrary to the Articles concluded at <hi>Perth.</hi> Thus much touching the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fons who did ſweare: The next thing yee conſider, is the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:26266:87"/>matter whereunto they did binde themſelues by their oath, which yee ſet downe as followeth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>PP.</speaker>
               <p>The matter whereunto they binde themſelues by oath, is the Religion, Doctrine, and Diſcipline receiued, beleeued, and defended by the Church of Scotland; in reſpect of this matter, the Oath is partly aſſertorie, and partly promiſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as yee ſay.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>ANS.</speaker>
               <p>By that which alreadie hath been ſaid, it is manifeſt, that albeit our Church had ſworne to all the heads and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces aboue ſpecified, ſet downe in the bookes of Diſcipline: yet there is nothing committed contrarie to this Oath, by the actes made at <hi>Perth.</hi> But now ſince yee are come to the matter of the Oath, let vs ſee if the points in controuerſie be any part of that matter. The matter, as yee affirme, is the Religion, Doctrine, and Diſcipline, receiued, beleeued, and defended by the Church of Scotland. This definition or deſcription of the matter, is not ſo full and particular, as is ſet downe in the Oath it ſelfe: neither haue yee, in reciting the words, been ſo faithfull, as yee are feruent for the cauſe yee maintaine. For yee haue pretermitted diuers things belonging to the limitation of the matter, by which all the particulars in queſtion are clearely excluded. The words cited by you are theſe: <hi>We beleeue with our hearts, confeſſe with our mouthes, ſubſcribe with our hands, and conſtantly affirme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and the world, That the Faith and Religion, receiued, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, and defended by the Church of Scotland, the Kings Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, and three Eſtates of this Realme,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is onely the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith and Religion pleaſing God, and bringing ſaluation to man.</hi> Heere yee omit many things that concerneth the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of the matter, which at that time were knowne to ſuch as ſware the ſame, and now muſt be expounded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Reader, that is to iudge and conſider our Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie. Therefore I ſhall ſet downe heere the words of the Oathe, as it was publiſhed in print by <hi>Robert Waldgraue,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:26266:88"/>anno</hi> 1590. <hi>We beleeue with our hearts, &amp;c. That this onely is the true Chriſtian Faith and Religion pleaſing God, and bringing ſaluation to man, which is now by the mercy of God reuealed to the world, by the preaching of the bleſſed Euangell, and receiued, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, &amp; defended by many &amp; ſundry notable Churches &amp; Realmes, and chiefely by the Church of Scotland, &amp;c.</hi> In theſe words we haue two limitations pretermitted by you: The firſt is, that the matter of the Oath, is the Doctrine and Diſcipline re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed to the world by the Goſpell: This limitation exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all Eccleſiaſticall determinations and conſtitutions, which are not expreſly, or by a neceſſary conſequence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the written Word. The next is, That the matter of the Oath is the Doctrine and Diſcipline, which is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, beleeued, and defended by many notable Churches and Realmes, and chiefely by the Church of Scotland. This limitation excludeth all theſe things, wherein the Church of Scotland hath not the conſent of many notable Churches and Realmes, who with her hath receiued, beleeued, and defended the ſame. By theſe two, are all the points in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie excluded, and cut off from being any part of the matter, whereunto the Swearers by their oath did oblige themſelues. And vnto theſe two, if we adde the third limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, there can remaine no more any doubt, touching the matter of the Oath. This is, that the Doctrine and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, whereunto they ſweare, is particularly expreſſed in the Confeſſion of Faith, eſtabliſhed, and publikely confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by ſundry actes of Parliament. This Confeſſion is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred in the bookes of Parliament, at the yeare 1567. and is inſerted amongſt the Confeſſions of the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the booke called <hi>Syntagma Confeſſionum.</hi> But ſo it is, that in the Confeſſion of our Faith eſtabliſhed by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there is no mention made of the Articles controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: neither hath many notable Churches and Realmes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, beleeued, or defended the ſame, neither are they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, or by neceſſary conſequence contained in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: And therefore they cannot by any point of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:26266:88"/>or part of the Doctrine and Diſcipline, whereunto the Swearers did oblige themſelues by their aſſertory, and promiſſory Oath. By the Goſpell it is not certaine, That our Sauiour and the Apoſtles did ſit at the Supper, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he had ſitten, yet ſitting is no more commanded to be obſerued in that ſacred action, then the vpper chamber where he ſate, or the night ſeaſon, when the Supper was celebrated, or the ſex, and number of the Communicants, who were twelue men, and no women; or the qualitie of the element, which was vnleauened bread, or the order fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally after Supper. All theſe, howbeit they be certaine, yet none of them are eſteemed exemplary; far leſſe can ſitting, which is vncertaine, be eſteemed ſuch. And for the reſt of the points, Neither kneeling at the Communion, nor the adminiſtration of the Sacraments in priuate houſes, when neceſſitie requires, nor the commemoration of Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable benefits, on certaine ſet times of the yeare, nor the triall of yong childrens education by the Biſhop at his Viſitation: none of theſe, I ſay, are either expreſly or by neceſſary conſequence forbidden in the Goſpell, nor are he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y condemned by many notable Churches and Realmes, nor abiured in the Confeſſion of our Faith, confirmed by actes of Parliament; and ſo cannot be counted the matter of this Oath.</p>
               <p>But to remooue all ſcruple that may ariſe, touching the matter of this Oath: It is true, That in the promiſſorie Oath, the Swearers thereof binde themſelues to continue in the Doctrine and Diſcipliue of the Church of Scotland, and to defend the ſame according to their vocation and power all the dayes of their liues, vnder the paines contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Law, and danger both of body and ſoule in the day of the Lords fearefull iudgement. Heere, touching the Doctrine, praiſed be God, there is no controuerſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs: all the doubt concerneth Diſcipline, and that is remoued alſo, if it be taken only for that which is reuealed in the Goſpell, or receiued, beleeued and defended by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:26266:89"/>notable Churches and Realmes, or that which is ſet downe in the Confeſſion of Faith, as is already declared: But becauſe the Diſcipline of the Church may be extended beyond theſe limits, and made to comprehend all Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall conſtitutions and determinations of generall circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, formes and ceremonies belonging to the worſhip of God, and the decent ordering of his houſe; let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this point more particularly.</p>
               <p>If by the Diſcipline of the Church in the words of the Oath,
<note place="margin">A conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Diſcipline whereunto the Swearers did oblige themſelues:</note> that part of Eccleſiaſticall policie bee meant, which concernes the cenſuring of manners: in which ſenſe it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, in the order ſet downe before our Pſalme bookes, and in the ſeuenth head of the firſt booke of Diſcipline, intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (of Eccleſiaſticall Diſcipline) and in the ſecond booke, whereſoeuer it is mentioned, and by all Eccleſiaſticall wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters moſt frequently: Then it is certaine, that the fiue Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles controuerted, belong nothing to the Diſcipline, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Swearers binde themſelues by their oath, to continue to their liues end.</p>
               <p>But if therby be meant the whole policie of the Church, in which ſenſe it is ſometimes taken, though rarely: then firſt, it containes all the precepts of policie preſcribed in the Word, in which precepts there is no determination concerning theſe articles, as before we ſaid. Next, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth all the ordinances of the Church, touching formes, ceremonies, and order to be obſerued in Diuine Seruice, and in the exerciſe of Eccleſiaſticall Cenſures, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the circumſtances of time, place, and perſons. In this part of Diſcipline, it is true, that all the controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted points are contained: But as I ſhewed before, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by the limitations of the matter of the Oath, that this part of the policie is excluded; for it is neither expreſſely, nor by neceſſary conſequence contained in the Word, uor is it receiued, beleeued, and deſended by many notable Churches and Realmes; nor is there any thing concerning it ſet downe in the Confeſſion of Faith, confirmed by actes
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:26266:89"/>of Parliament; onely this generall wee haue, that no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant order and policie can be ſet downe in ceremonies, and that conſtitutions made by men, may and ought to be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red when need requires.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, in the booke of Policie that was publiſhed after the Oath, <hi>anno</hi> 1581, and ſubſcribed by ſundrie Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, there is no mention made of theſe fiue: Articles now in queſtion. In the firſt booke of Diſcipline penned <hi>anno</hi> 1560, there are ſome concluſions ſet downe touching ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the Sacrament, the abolition of Holy dayes dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to Saints in Popery, and the Feaſt of Chriſtmas, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed vpon the conſciences of men; as alſo the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Baptiſme vpon ordinary dayes of preaching, for remouing the Papiſticall opinion of abſolute neceſſitie; and if by the diſcipline mentioned in the Oath, yee vnderſtand the concluſions of Policie ſet downe in that booke, and hold that the Swearers did by their Oath oblige themſelues to obey all the concluſions thereof to their liues end: then I demand what is the cauſe, that yee and your followers do not only refuſe to obey, but improue and impugne the moſt principall point of policie ſet downe in that booke, namely the office of Biſhops, whoſe prouiſion, juriſdiction, power and election, are particularly deſcribed in the firſt head of that booke, vnder the name of Superintendents? But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the booke is rare, and not at euery mans hand, I will draw out of it onely ſome few things, touching the juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and power of the Superintendents, that the poſterity may ſee what was the judgement of their Predeceſſors, the Reformers of Religion, touching the Office-bearers, and gouernment of the Church. And to beginne with the bounds of their juriſdiction, the ſame is ſet down with this Title:</p>

               <p>They muſt further conſider, how the poore are prouided, and the youth inſtructed: they muſt admoniſh, where ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition needs, and redreſſe ſuch things, as by good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell they are able to appeaſe,</p>
               <p>Finally, they muſt note ſuch crimes as be hainous, that by the cenſures of the Church the ſame may bee corrected. After all this, the order of election of Superintendents is ſet downe, which we haue more largely before the booke of our Pſalmes in meeter.</p>
               <p>This being one of the chiefe points of policie concluded in that booke: how is it, that yee haue diſpenſed with your oath hereabout? And by what power is your oath looſed concerning this head? Shall men bee tyed by the Oath to the ceremonies preſcribed in that booke, and not to the ſubſtance of the policie? to alterable circumſtances and formes of actions, and not to the power of gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby they ſhould be diſpoſed and ordered? What can be anſwered to this, by him that vrges the Oath for the controuerted points, conſiſting in ceremonies, geſtures and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:26266:91"/>circumſtances, lot the indifferent Reader iudge.</p>
               <p>But becauſe it is true, that one mans fault excuſes not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; leauing you to your conſciences, we anſwere for our ſelues, according to the one and twentieth article of the Confeſſion of our Faith; <hi>That we thinke no policie, nor order in ceremonies can be eſtabliſhed to endure for all ages, times and places; and that whatſoeuer things are appointed by men, they are all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, and may, and ought to be changed, when neceſſitie requireth.</hi> Hereupon we ſay, That no man did by the Oath oblige him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to obey and defend that part of Diſcipline which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth theſe alterable things, all the dayes of his life, but onely that diſcipline which is vnchangeable, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Word. Yea, we further affirme, that euery man who ſware to the diſcipline of the Church in generall; by vertue of that oath ſtandeth obliged, not only to obey and defend the conſtitutions of the Church, that were in force at the time of making his oath, but alſo to obey and defend whatſoeuer the Church thereafter hath ordained, or ſhall ordaine to be obſerued for edification, comlineſſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, whether thereby the former conſtitutions bee eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed or altered, and abrogated: euen as they who ſweare to obey the gouernment of a Kingdome or Citie, are by their oath not onely obliged to obey the preſent Actes and Lawes, but all, which ſhall afterwards bee made for the Common-wealth, howbeit the former be thereby diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: as when Lawes are made for exportation and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of goods, for weights and meaſures, for fiſhing, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of woods, for peace, for warre, and whatſoeuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions they bee that are made, ſuch as haue giuen their oath of obedience are thereby tyed to reject the former, and obey the later. I conclnde this with the doctrine of that learned Diuine, Maſter CALVINE, <hi>Inſtit. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. <hi>ſect.</hi> 30. <hi>God would not</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>in externall ceremonies and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline preſcribe particularly what we ought to follow, becauſe he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw that, to depend on the condition of times, neither did he iudge one forme agreeable to all ages. Heare then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we muſt flie
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:26266:91"/>to the generall rules which God hath giuen, that according to them may be defined, whatſoeuer the neceſſitie of the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires to be appointed for order and deceneie. Finally, ſeeing God hath ſet downe nothing of thoſe matters expreſſely, becauſe they are not neceſſary to ſaluation, and are diuerſely to bee applyed, to the manners of euery age, and for edification of the Church; it is lawfull, as the vtilitie of the Church ſhall require, as wel to change and abrogate theſe that haue been in vſe, as to appoint new cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. I confeſſe indeed, that we ſhould not runne raſhly and vpon light motions, vnto nouation: but what may hurt, and what may edifie, Charity can beſt iudge, which, if wee admit to bee modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix, all ſhall be in ſafetie, and goe well.</hi> Thus farre <hi>Caluine,</hi> whereby he doth manifeſt, that the Church hath power to change and innouate, as neceſſity requireth, all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ordinances ſhee maketh of things alterable: and they who in generall haue ſworne to obey the Diſcipline of the Church, are all bound by their oath to kneele at the Communion, to obſerue the fiue Holy dayes, and to obey all the reſt of the Articles concluded at <hi>Perth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which yee afterwards ſubjoyne, touching the forme and force of the Oath we approue: onely we wiſh you to conſider, ſeeing it is a part of Eccleſiaſticall Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, as well to change and abrogate ceremoeies in vſe, as to appoint new: That yee by all theſe forcible formes of the Oath, which cannot be looſed, are obliged to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Church in the alterations ſhee makes, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and obey the Actes and Conſtitutions that concerne the ſame; and that all, who diſobey in their owne perſons, or by their exemplary practiſe and perſwaſions, induce others to diſobey and rebell, to the diſgrace of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church, and the breaking of the bond of peace, whereby the vnitie of the Spirit is conſerued, doe aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly lye tyed vnder the foarefull cords and chaines of periury, except they ſeriouſly repent.</p>
               <p>The Libeller hauing ended his foure Conſiderations, propounds ſome defences vſed by them, who ſubmit
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:26266:92"/>themſelues to the Actes of <hi>Perth,</hi> whom contumeliouſly he calleth <hi>Temporizers,</hi> and to other Defences maketh his owne Replies. Firſt, ſaith he, they make themſelues freed of the Oath, becauſe the nouation was made by the King, and the Church, their Superiours: vnto this he giueth a double anſwere: firſt, that this nouation could not bee lawfully made by the King, becauſe hee himſelfe did ſweare the Confeſſion of Faith: Next, that the Church could not make any ſuch nouation, becauſe all of the Church did ſweare the Oath, either perſonally or really: Perſonally, all who ſubſcribed the Confeſſion of Faith, which he reckons to haue been the generall aſſemblies of the Church, Synods, Presbyteries, Schollers paſſing their degrees, and Burgeſſes, when they obtained their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: Really, Children ſweare in the perſons of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and all the particular members of the Church, in the Church repreſentatiue. This his Aſſertion, being du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examined, will bee found falſe, for the greateſt part, touching the perſons, whom he alledgeth to haue ſworn: and as to their reall obligation, it is friuolous; for no man can bee really bound by an aſſertory oath, but onely the perſon that ſweares. But paſſing by this, I anſwer, That when the King and Church ſweare the Confeſſion of Faith, by that Oath, they did neither abiure any of the Articles concluded at <hi>Perth,</hi> neither did oblige them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to maintaine and obey the contrary: for it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by the limitations ſet downe in the beginning of the Oath, that all theſe particulars were excluded. And they who ſweare to continue in the Diſcipline of the Church of Scotland generally, and to defend the ſame all the dayes of their life, were ſo farre from tying themſelues to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the obedience of euery particular ordinance tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching indifferent and alterable things; that by the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, the one and twentieth Article of the Confeſſion of Faith aboue rehearſed, they ſtood obliged to obey euery alteration, that ſhould be concluded by the Church. The
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:26266:92"/>Church repreſentatiue did ſweare in that Article, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all ſuch conſtitutions, when it ſhould be needfull: and the particular members of the Church ſweare to obey her will and ordinance in the points altered and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. For to obey the Diſcipline in generall, is to obey euery thing, that the Church by the power giuen her of God appointeth to bee done, or not done, for order and policie: So, for any nouation that is made, neither hath the King, nor the Church repreſentatiue violated their Oath, nor haue the inferiour members beene looſed and freed from their oathes, but in giuing obedience to the points of Diſcipline concluded by their Superiours, they made their oathes and promiſes good, which otherwiſe by their diſobedience they ſhould haue tranſgreſſed.</p>
               <p>As to the Oath which (as you ſay) the Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> now Biſhop of <hi>Wineheſter,</hi> affirmeth his Maieſtie twice to haue giuen, for maintaining that ſorme and manner of Gods worſhip eſtabliſhed by the Lawes of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, you might eaſily haue perceiued, that he did not by the forme which he mentioneth, vnderſtand theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different points of policie, wherein ſome little diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity there is, and cannot but be, in regard of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent eſtate of our Church and theirs; but by that forme, her vnderſtood that ſame faſhion and manner of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping God, as is preſcribed to vs in his Word, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned in the ſeuerall Confeſſions of our Faith, which is one, and the ſame both with them and vs. So you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praue that reuerend Fathers ſpeech, and craftily inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate his Maieſtie to be guiltie of periury, in that by his Highneſſe moſt lawfull and earneſt deſire, the alteration of theſe indifferent things hath beene wrought: but yee ſhould know, that theſe are but things acceſſory to the eſſentiall forme of Gods worſhip, whereunto his Maieſty did ſweare at his Coronation, which to this day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly he hath maintained, and will by the grace of God for many yeares after, yea, euen vntill that temporall
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:26266:93"/>Crowne bee changed with that eternall.</p>
               <p>Another defence ye alledge is vſed by the Paſtors, and Profeſſors that liue obedient to the Laws of the Church: They haue not violated their Oath, they ſay, becauſe the ſubſtance of Religion is kept, and onely ſome indifferent points altered. And to this yee make three replyes: Firſt, ſaying, That we ſware to keepe the ſame forme of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that was vſed in the Church of Scotland, and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the vſe of the Sacraments. Secondly, That the Oath was in a matter of Religion, which is not changea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as are the Statutes of Republiques and Corporations. Thirdly, Put the caſe, yee ſay, the points innouated were matters indifferent; yet ſeeing they were once abiured for their abuſe, they may not be receiued againe, except either we could prooue, that our oath in the beginning was vnlawfull, or that our former formes are become vnlawfull, not expedient for edification of the Church, or leſſe edificatiue, then the ceremonies preſently vrged.</p>
               <p>I anſwere to the firſt, That the forme of worſhip vſed in the Church of Scotland is not altered; for ſtill we hold that forme of worſhip, which is preſcribed to vs in the Word, defended &amp; receiued by many notable Churches and Realmes, and particularly contained in the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Faith. As for the geſture and kneeling, and thoſe other circumſtances of times and places, where the Sacraments may be miniſtred in caſes of extremity, there is no man, being in his right wits, that will thinke the forme of Gods worſhip conſiſteth in ſuch things, or that they are any part thereof. Your ſecond reply we admit, and affirme according thereto, That the matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, whereto we ſware, is not alterable, nor can it bee changed. And that the points queſtioned, being of their owne nature indifferent, are excluded from the Oath, and are no part of the matter thereof.</p>
               <p>To your third reply, I anſwere, That wee haue not receiued any thing againe in our Church, which euer was
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:26266:93"/>damned, and abiured for their abuſe: for in the negatiue part of our oath, wherein Papiſtrie is abiured, there is no mention of kneeling, nor of the commemoration of Chriſts benefits vpon the fiue anniuerſary dayes, nor is any of the other three Articles euer touched. It is true, that Popiſh dedication of dayes to other Creatures, and the obſeruation of them, with an opinion of neceſſitie, or that they were any part of Gods worſhip, are abiured in that Confeſſion, (and that alſo wee haue condemned in the Acte made at <hi>Perth,</hi> concerning the obſeruation of theſe times:) but to make commemoration of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, that our Sauiour by his Birth, Paſſion, Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion hath brought vnto vs, we neuer held it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, nor did count it a matter of abuſe. Therefore it is not neceſſary, that either our oath be proued vnlawful, or our former formes; it ſufficeth, that they bee prooued leſſe edificatiue, or not ſo expedient for the time, becauſe they are abuſed by the people to ſuperſtition and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe, as afterwards we will make cleare in their owne place.</p>
               <p>Where yee ſay, That it was confeſſed in the Aſſembly, that they were not expedient for our Church, and that the ſame were yeelded vnto, for holding of ſome exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall inconueniences, a matter now denied, yee ſay, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting tyrannie, becauſe you confeſſe, you haue this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by report; and it is the nature of all your ſort to be too credulous, we paſſe it. In the meane time wee will not deny, that to ſome, they appeared very inexpedient, for diuers reſpects, of the which the chiefe were, the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit they feared to icurre with their people, that did eſteeme the condemning of the abuſe of theſe ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, to haue been an abſolute reiecting of them, as cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies idolatrous, which neuer was done by any prudent or wiſe Paſtor: another reſpect was, becauſe ſimple ones, that had not learned to make diſtinction betweene cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and the ſubſtance of Religion, might take
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:26266:94"/>occaſion by the alteration of theſe externall things, to thinke that wee began to change Religion in ſubſtance: and a third reſpect was, that by embracing theſe things, we did ſeeme to ſymbolize with Papiſts, and were tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning backe againe to their ſuperſtition and idolatrie. Theſe were and are the chiefeſt reſpects, for which they were not thought expedient to bee receiued in our Church.</p>
               <p>To begin at the laſt whereof, that is, our conformitie with Papiſts; It is needfull that our people bee taught, that the diſconformitie betweene them and vs, is not ſo much in any externall vſe of ceremonies, as in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Seruice, and object whereunto they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. In kneeling at Prayer, and receiuing of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there is no diſconformitie betweene them and vs, but in the obïect, whereunto our kneeling is directed: for the Papiſts in prayer kneele to an Idoll, and in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they kneele to the ſigne: wee kneele in our prayer to God; and by the Sacrament, to the thing ſignified. So in our ceſſation from ordinary worke on the Lords day, and on the Holy daies now appointed, there is no diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie; but the difference is in the employment of the time, and in the exerciſe and worſhip, for which the ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is commanded.</p>
               <p>For the ſimple ones; It is moſt expedient, to teach them to put diſtinction between the ceremonies, and the ſubſtance of Religion; betweene that, which is neceſſary to be obſerued as a part of Gods worſhip, and that which is onely ordained for order and decencie: for it is a kinde of ſuperſtition, to eſteeme indifferent ceremonies, and circumſtances of Diuine Seruice to bee eſſentiall parts thereof; which may not be omitted or changed, without breach of Gods inſtitution: This is, to obſerue things, or abſtaine from them, with opinion of neceſſitie, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience &amp; Religion towards God. And ſeeing the Church ought to change and alter ceremonies, when they are
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:26266:94"/>thus abuſed by people vnto ſuperſtition, this is one preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant reaſon wherefore the alteration ſhould haue beene made.</p>
               <p>As to that which they ſpeake of the credite of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, the ſame ought not to be maintained, by foſtering an errour in the hearts of people; namely, that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters taught that which they neuer taught, or at leaſt ſhould not haue taught: As by example, that the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the fiue Holy dayes, to the commemoration of Chriſts benefits, is vnlawfull. This I am aſſured was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuer done by any well aduiſed Preacher, for it had bin a condemning of the Primitiue Church, and all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches now in the world, Likewiſe, to haue taught that kneeling in the acte of receiuing the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is vnlawfull, were to haue contradicted the beſt, and moſt learned Diuines we haue. <hi>Beza</hi> ſaith of it, <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciem habet piae, ac Chriſtianae venerationis, ac proinde olim potuit cum fructu vſurpari.</hi> That is to ſay, kneeling at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath a ſhew of holy and Chriſtian worſhippe, and therefore of old might haue been fruitfully vſed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by yee ſee, he condemneth not ſimply the ceremonie, but witneſſeth that there was a time, when the ſame did edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and profite. <hi>Caluine,</hi> before him, called it <hi>Cultum legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timum,</hi> that is, a Lawfull adoration, being vſed in the action of the Supper, and directed to Chriſt. <hi>Petrus Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi> ſaith, <hi>Multi piè genua flectunt &amp; adorant,</hi> that is, Many in receiuing the Sacrament doe bow their knees religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and adore Chriſts fleſh. <hi>Paraeus</hi> ſpeaking of the ſame geſture, eſteemes it an indifferent ceremonie. And that which ſo great and learned Diuines iudged to bee lawfull, what are we to condemne?</p>
               <p>Next, I anſwere, That the credite of the Paſtours ſhould not be maintained with the diſcredit of the Prince amongſt his Subiects: for if they who ſhould be patternes of reuerence and obedience to others, ſhall in their owne perſons withſtand the lawfull deſires, &amp; godly intention
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:26266:95"/>of a Chriſtian Prince, the ſame cannot but breed diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and a hard conceit of the Prince amongſt his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which we haue already found and perceiued. As for the inconueniences feared, they are friuolous, and ſhould neuer fall out, if Paſtors were peaceable and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: But when they are all put together that can bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, if they ſhall bee laid in a ballance, there is one commoditie, which the alteration imports, that ſhall preponder them all, to wit, Our vnitie and conformitie with the Primitiue Church, and with the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and beſt Reformed Churches in <hi>Europe,</hi> in points of policie, that moſt aſſuredly tend to farre greater deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, piety and edification, then our formes vſed in former times.</p>
               <p>This being his Maieſties principall deſigne in vrging theſe Articles, giueth to the world an euident teſtimony of his Princely zeale, to procure the peace and good of the Church, ſo farre as is poſſible; and therefore none will charge his Maieſty with the vniuſt imputation of tyranny, but malicious and ſeditious ſpirits, whom by this peſtilent Pamphlet ye trauell to perſwade, for feare of periury, to periure themſelues, as is manifeſt in the words yee ſubioyne.</p>

If ſincere and conſtant profeſſors ſhalbe ſtill purſued for their conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in their Profeſſion, and the conſcience they make of the Oath: doe we not expone the whole Nation to a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vengeance, and perpetuall ignominy?</p>

                  <p>After yee haue laid downe your grounds; ſome for ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and ſome againſt kneeling: yee ſubioyne the tenor of the acte concluded at <hi>Perth,</hi> but moſt corruptly, as we haue noted in the margine; and then yee forme this argument: That which hath been eſtabliſhed by ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lawes Ciuill and Eccleſiaſticall, by ſo long cuſtome, and preſcription of time, and confirmed by oathes and ſubſcriptions, we may not lawfully alter: But ſo it is, that ſitting at Table, in the acte of receiuing, hath beene eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by lawes, cuſtomes, long preſcription of time, and confirmed by oathes and ſubſcriptions.</p>
                  <p>A man that had heard the propoſition only, would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſome great matter in the aſſumption, belonging to ſome article of Faith, or precept of obedience ſet downe in Gods Word: and all reſolues in an indifferent ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of ſitting at the Sacrament. But yet to make ſimple people beleeue, that it were ſome neceſſary or ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all point of Religion, that might not be altered, ye make a great ſhew of lawes, cuſtomes, &amp;c, which being exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſhall vaniſh as ſmoake before the winde. And where yee beginne with a ſtrong alleageance, that it was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed with ſo many lawes Ciuill and Eccleſiaſticall: I aske you firſt, by what Ciuill lawes? Yee ſay, (ſo many) yet in your deduction, whereby you affirme the aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be euident, yee cite not one law, neither can yee, albeit yee are not aſhamed to ſay (ſo many). For your Eccleſiaſticall lawes, yee cite firſt, the words ſet downe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:26266:97"/>in the ſecond head of the firſt booke of Diſcipline; the Table of the Lord is then rightly miniſtred, &amp;c. Theſe words are not a law, for that booke of Diſcipline was neuer receiued, nor confirmed, either by the Ciuill, or Eccleſiaſticall eſtate; ſome of the Nobility ſubſcribed it, but others, who had the chiefe authority, as Maſter <hi>Knox</hi> complaines in his Hiſtory, reiected the ſame, calling it <hi>Deuout imaginations.</hi> Next, yee cite the ordinance of the generall Aſſembly, 1562, appointing the order of <hi>Geneua</hi> to be obſerued: this Act cannot eſtabliſh your ſitting, for in <hi>Geneua,</hi> they ſtand, or paſſe, as they Receiue, and ſit not at Table. The laſt Acte, which yee cite in <hi>anno</hi> 1564, ordaineth Miniſters in the miniſtration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, to vſe the order ſet downe in the Pſalme book. In that Act there is no mention of ſitting, and by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſet downe in the Pſalme bookes, that may be meant, which before was called, the order of <hi>Geneua.</hi> How ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it be, there is no particular law for ſitting, no Ciuil law at all: and none Eccleſiaſticall; but this onely one, which is generall.</p>
                  <p>Your ſecond probation is, That ſitting is eſtabliſhed by ſo long a cuſtome and preſcription of time: Who would not, when he heares <hi>(ſo long)</hi> looke at leaſt for a three or foure hundred yeares? and all this length of time yee can alledge to, is ſince the yeare of God 1560, not halfe an age: before which time, kneeling was in vſe many hundred yeares on the Lords day, and on other dayes in the weeke, euer ſince the firſt Inſtitution, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſhall be proued, with better reaſons, then any yee can bring for the neceſſity of ſitting. This long cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome and preſcription for kneeling, yee eſteeme to be of no moment, albeit it was a geſture inſtituted by God: but for ſitting, a geſture inſtituted by man; yee count eight and fifty yeares a long preſcription. So men eſteeme their owne Dwarfes to be Giants, <hi>Noſtrum ſic nanum Atlanta vocamus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:26266:97"/>
                  <p>The laſt argument wherein yee glory moſt, is, that ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is confirmed by oathes and ſubſcriptions: This is a childiſh and falſe alledgeance: for there was neuer oath, nor ſubſcription giuen in our Church, that by any conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence can import a confirmation of ſitting, or of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indifferent alterable ceremonie for all times follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Seeing no man is aſtricted longer vnto the obſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of it, then the Eccleſiaſticall Conſtitution ſtands, which being altered by the Church that made it, their oath and ſubſcription bindes them to obſerue that, which in ſtead of the former, is ordained to be receiued. This is manifeſt by the Conſtitutions ſet downe in the ſeuenteenth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the booke of Diſcipline, receiued and confirmed in the generall Aſſembly holden at <hi>Glaſgow</hi> the 24. of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prill, anno</hi> 1581, the tenor whereof followes: <hi>The finall end of all Aſſemblies, is firſt to keepe the Religion and Doctrine in purity, without errour or corruption. Next to keepe comlineſſe and good order in the Church: for this orders cauſe, they may make certaine rules and conſtitutions, pertaining to the good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour of all the members of the Church in their owne vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: They haue power alſo to abrogate and aboliſh all ſtatutes and ordinances, concerning Eccleſiaſticall matters, that are found noyſome and vnprofitable, and agree not with the time, or are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed by the people.</hi> And after a few words, it is ſubioyned: <hi>That it appertaines to the Presbyteries, to cauſe the Ordinances made by the Aſſemblies Prouinciall and generall, to be kept and put in execution.</hi> Hereby it is manifeſt, that when the Church alters indifferent thing in policie, that they who are aſtricted by their oathes to obey the Diſcipline of the Church, are tyed, both not to practiſe theſe things, which the Church hath diſcharged; and to obſerue theſe things, which the Church, in ſtead thereof, hath eſtabliſhed to be done. Whereupon I conclude, That ſo many as haue ſworne and ſubſcribed, (after the forme contained in the Oath) to continue in the obedience of the Diſcipline of the Church; are all obliged by their ſubſcriptions, now
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:26266:98"/>not to ſit, but to kneele at the Communion: becauſe the Church hath found it meete, that ſitting ſhould bee inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed with kneeling? Thus I haue anſwered your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, lawes, cuſtomes, ſubſcriptions and oathes, which yee bring for ſitting.</p>
                  <p>I come to conſider the ordinances made, as ye alledge, againſt kneeling: where firſt yee alledge an Act made in the Aſſembly 1591, that an Article ſhould bee formed, and preſented vnto his Maieſty, and the Eſtates, for order to be taken with them, who giue or receiue the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments after the Papiſtical manner; but by Papiſtical ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is meante, the giuing of the Sacrament by a Maſſe Prieſt, and the receiuing the ſame after the order of the Romane Church: which may be cleared by an Act of the Aſſembly, <hi>anno</hi> 1565. <hi>Decemb.</hi> 26. <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 2. The tenor wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is this: <hi>Perſons reuolting from the profeſſion of the Goſpell, by offering their children to be baptized after the Papiſticall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or by themſelues receiuing the Sacrament of the Altar, after admonition, ſhall bee excommunicate, if repentance interuene not.</hi> This ſheweth what is meant by giuing, or receiuing the Sacrament in a Papiſticall manner; for it was neuer our Churches meaning, to cenſure theſe that receiued the Sacraments after the manner of the Reformed Churches in France, England, or Germany, where many of our people haue receiued the Sacrament of Chriſts bodie kneeling: Nor did our Predeceſſors euer condemne their cuſtomes, and eſteeme ſitting neceſſary, albeit for the eſtate of our Church, they held it in the beginning to be moſt conuenient.</p>
                  <p>Next, yee ſay, That in the Kings Confeſſion of Faith, &amp;c. are theſe words contained: <hi>We deteſt the ceremonies of the Romane Antichriſt, added to the miniſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and we deteſt all his rites, ſignes, and traditions.</hi> This ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument were good, if yee did proue kneeling to be a rite or ceremony added to the Sacrament, by the Roman An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt. But we know this ceremony to be diuine, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:26266:98"/>not Antichriſtian, a ceremony allowed by God to bee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in his worſhip: for he hath ſaid expreſly in his Word, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto me all knees ſhall how:</hi> and againe, <hi>In the name of Ieſus euery knee ſhall bow.</hi> Neither will yee euer be able to proue the vſe of this ceremony, in receiuing the Sacrament, to be Antichriſtian; or to haue been inſtituted by the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt of Rome: for albeit <hi>Honorius</hi> ordained that the people ſhould kneele at the eleuation, and circumgeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Hoſte to thoſe who are ſicke, yet he made no conſtitution for kneeling at the receiuing of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and there is as great difference betweene the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation in the Maſſe, and the pompous circumgeſtation of the Hoſte, and the celebration of the Sacrament, as is betwixt an idolatrous, and ſuperſtitious inuention of man, and a lawfull act of diuine worſhip. Therefore to conclude the anſwere of this Section, vnto the argument propounded by you, I oppone this.</p>

                  <p>The Propoſition is manifeſt by theſe Conſtitutions, which we haue cited out of the ſeuenteenth chapter of the booke of Diſcipline, confirmed in the Aſſembly, 1581, and ſubſcribed by many of the Miniſtry. Yea, the very nature of alterable ceremonies is ſuch, that to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of them no man is longer aſtricted, then they ſtand in their integritie without change; but if for any
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:26266:99"/>corruption and abuſe, or for ſome greater or better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, they be altered by the Church, the obligation for obſeruing of them ceaſes, and bindes no more.</p>
                  <p>As to kneeling, which the Aſſembly hath ordained in ſtead of ſitting, as yet we haue ſeene nothing againſt it, neither Law Ciuill or Eccleſiaſticall, nor cuſtome, &amp;c.

                  <p>The firſt breach of the inſtitution by kneeling, is, the taking away of that commendable geſture of ſitting, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, at and after the Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. That Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſate at Table, yee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to proue it, by the words of the Euangeliſt, <hi>Edenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus illis,</hi> whileſt they did eate, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.26. <hi>Mark.</hi> 14.22. <hi>Chriſt tooke bread, and bleſſed,</hi> &amp;c.

The phraſe imports, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing interuened betwixt the eating, and the celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sacrament; it was therfore miniſtred vnto them ſitting.

                  <p>Your argument is, <hi>a captione à fallacia conſequentis:</hi> For albeit nothing interuened betweene the eating of the Paſchall Supper, and the celebration of the Sacrament, yet it followeth not, that the Sacrament was miniſtred vnto them ſitting. For as yee ſay, their eating of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchall Supper and ſitting were coniunct; and that eating of the Paſchall Supper ceaſing at the beginning of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of this Sacrament; how will it follow, that the geſture of ſitting continued, and was not changed? For although nothing interuened betweene the Paſchall Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and the Sacrament, yet the geſture might haue beene
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:26266:99"/>changed, when the action was changed. And as the one action ceaſed when the other began, ſo the geſture of ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting might haue ceaſed with the action, wherewith it was conioyned: and another geſture might haue begun, and been vſed in the celebration of the Sacrament. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, betwixt their eating of the Paſchall Supper, and the adminiſtration of the Sacrament to the Diſciples, there interuened diuers actes; as firſt, the taking of the bread: ſecondly, the thankeſgiuing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thirdly, the breaking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the precept, <hi>Take yee, eate yee:</hi> fiftly, the word where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the element was made the Sacrament. After this, the Sacrament was giuenby our Sauiour, and receiued by the Diſciples, which yee call the miniſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnto them. Now albeit it were true, that between the time they ſate eating of the Paſchall Supper, and the time when the Sacrament began to bee celebrated, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing had interuened: yet betwixt that, and the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring of the Sacrament to the Diſciples, all theſe fiue acts interuened. In which time, the geſture of ſitting might haue beene changed: for if they changed it not at the breaking of the bred by our Sauiour, which was the firſt act, yet they might haue changed it at the thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing, which was the ſecond; or at the breaking, which was the third; or at Chriſts pronouncing of the words, whereby the element became a Sacrament. So vpon this ground, that they were ſitting, and eating, yee cannot conclude, that they receiued the Sacrament ſitting; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betwixt the time of their eating of the Paſchall Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ſo many acts interuened, wherein the geſture of ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting might haue beene changed, before they receiued the Sacrament. Thus it is not certaine, that they ſate, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the Sacrament, or, as yee ſay, that the Sacrament was miniſtred vnto them ſitting. If it be replied, that it is not written, that they roſe, and altered their geſture: I anſwere, <hi>à non ſcriptum, ad non factum eſt, non valet conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentia.</hi> It is not written, that they altered their geſture,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:26266:100"/>therefore they did not alter it: it followeth not in Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, this conſequence is euer good.</p>

                  <p>In this argument, hee takes it for granted, that the Diſciples ſate at the Sacrament, which yet is in queſtion, and by Scripture ſhall neuer be decided. And this is a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſticke deception, called <hi>petitio principij.</hi> Next, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whereby hee prooues that ſitting was inſtituted, and not the other circumſtances, which were likewiſe retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; is becauſe Chriſt might haue changed it in ſtanding, or kneeling, without working a miracle. But this reaſon, I hope, will not be found demonſtratiue; for our Sauiour, without working a miracle, might haue changed the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per chamber, wherin he eat the Paſſeouer, &amp; taken him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to ſome other roome. Therefore by your argument his minde was, that we ſhould only celebrate the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in an vpper chamber. Likewiſe our Sauiour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out working of a miracle, might eaſily haue called his Mother, and other women to the Sacrament, and ſo haue altered the ſex, and number of the Communicants: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was his mind by your reaſon, that twelue men ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at once at Table, and no women, ſhould receiue the Sacrament. Finally, our Sauiour might haue celebrated the Sacrament without his vpper garment, which he did put on, after he had waſhed his Diſciples feete, before he celebrated the Sacrament. Therefore <hi>Baronius</hi> the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall concludes wel by your ground, That it was his mind the Prieſt ſhould put on his Maſſe-clothes, which are his vpper garment, before he celebrated the Sacrament. But that all men may ſee the vanity of this argument, I ſhall clearly proue by it, that ſitting was not inſtituted: Chriſt, yee ſay, might eaſily haue changed the geſture, which he vſed at the Paſchall Supper, without the working of a miracle; in ſtanding, or kneeling, if it had not been his minde, that we ſhould receiue the Sacrament of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſticall
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:26266:101"/>Supper, with the ſame geſture that the Iewes receiued the Paſchall. Now I aſſume, But the Iewes this night receiued the Paſchall Supper, not ſitting right vp in chaires or fourmes as we do, but lying on beds; although that both the geſtures might haue been, and were vſed by them in other nights, as is manifeſt by the teſtimonie which you cite your ſelfe out of SCALIGER, <hi>De emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datione temporum, lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Quòd in omnibus alijs noctibus tam edentes, quàm bibentes, vel ſedemus, vel diſcumbimus, in hac autem omnes diſcumbimus.</hi> That is to ſay, Other nights, eating or drinking, we either ſit at table, or lye; This night we all lye (yee turne it, we all ſuppe, that is, ſit lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.) Thus then I reaſon vpon the ground of your owne demonſtration: The geſture of lying, vſed by our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our at the Paſchal Supper, according to the cuſtom of the Iewes, might haue eaſily and commodiouſly been chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, without working a miracle, by turning about his face and body to the Table, and ſetting of himſelfe right vpon the beddes, with his feete to the ground, as our cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome is to ſitte at table. Therefore, according to your owne principle, it was not Chriſts minde, that we ſhould ſitte vpright at table, as wee doe, and all the Iewes in thoſe dayes vſed to doe at other times; but that wee ſhould lye at table, as the Iewes did at the Supper of the Paſſeouer. Now let the judicious Reader conſider, if this be a ſure ground, whereupon to ſettle a certaine and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible point of Gods worſhip.

                  <p>More impertinent teſtimonies yee could not haue brought, then the laſt two, and if they be rightly cited, let the Reader iudge: to the firſt, wherein mention is made of the cuſtome of the Churches, I anſwere: If the cuſtome of the Church, and the actions and practiſes of Chriſt be morall, and of the nature of things comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded generally in the Decalogue, they oblige vs indeed to imitation; but naturall actions, ſuch as eating, drinking, waking, ſleeping, reſting, talking, and ſuch like done by them, with the circumſtances thereof; namely, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, time, and place, of their eating, drinking, &amp;c. doe not tye vs to the imitation of them, although there bee no cauſe mouing them thereto, which concernes vs not. Therefore in all things we are not obliged to their imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Neither doe the ceremonies and circumſtances ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued by them in the exerciſe of Religion, aſtrict vs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they be enioyned by ſome conſtant precept in the Goſpell: as by example, <hi>Iohn</hi> baptiſed at a riuer, and they who were baptiſed went downe into the water, and came vp out of it againe: in ſome places the Church vſed a threefold immerſion: in the Apoſtles time, they vſed to ſalute one another with a holy kiſſe: they kept their banquets of loue at their meetings, and other moe cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes they had, which not being enioyned to vs by a conſtant command, doe no wiſe oblige vs: as no more
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:26266:103"/>doth the circumſtance of place, time, habite, perſons, poſition, and ſite of body, as ſtanding, ſitting or walking. And in a word, in the actions of Chriſt, his Apoſtles, or the cuſtomes of the Church, there is nothing exemplary, and left to be imitated of vs, but that which either being morall is generally commanded in the Decalogue, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ceremoniall and circumſtantiall, is particularly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by ſome conſtant precept in the Goſpell. But I will aske you, that would haue euery action of Chriſts to be imitated by vs, which hath not a ſpeciall exception of ſome cauſe, mouing him, that concernes vs not: what is the cauſe, that at the celebration of the Sacrament, yee bleſſe not the Bread firſt, ſeuerally by it ſelfe, and the Cup ſeuerally by it ſelfe, after the diſtribution of the Bread? ſeeing Chriſt did ſo, as it is expreſly mentioned, yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no cauſe to moue him, which concernes vs not. This I am perſwaded, if your ground bee ſure, is a more eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent breach of the Inſtitution, then is our not ſitting at the Sacrament: for in the words of the Inſtitution, there is no mention of ſitting, but the giuing of thankes twice is expreſly ſet downe; and there could bee no cauſe to moue Chriſt vnto this, which doth not concerne vs. For ſitting (if it be ſo, that Chriſt ſate) there is a manifeſt cauſe moouing him vnto that, which doth not concerne vs, to wït, the Paſchall Supper, by occaſion whereof, he was ſitting before. Therefore to conclude, if it bee no breach of the Inſtitution, once to giue thanks, and bleſſe the bread and cup at once, which Chriſt Ieſus in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is ſaid to haue done at two ſeuerall times, it is without all reaſon, to make that neceſſary, which is not expreſſed in the Inſtitution; and call that a breach of the Inſtitution, which neuer was inſtituted. Thus hauing ſhewed the ground, whereupon you build your exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie actions, to bee a heape of ſand, ſcraped together by your ſelfe, without warrant of Scripture, Antiquity, or any moderne Writer; the arguments yee bring after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:26266:103"/>from the ſitting of Chriſt with ſome of the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples after his Reſurrection, when he was at <hi>Emmaus;</hi> and the ſitting of the Apoſtolike Church, after our Sauiours Aſcenſion, are to no purpoſe: ſeeing your rule failes, and cannot proue the ſitting of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, at the Sacrament (if ſo they ſate) to be exemplary, more then any of the other circumſtances of time, place, order, and perſons. But that the Reader may ſee, how vncertaine your teſtimonies and reaſons are, we will conſider them particularly.</p>

                  <p>I ſee not, that they did acknowledge the Diſciples to haue ſate at Table, when they receiued: for as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there interuened betweene the taking of the bread by Chriſt, and the receiuing of the ſame by the Diſciples, the act of thaukeſgiuing, breaking and giuing the bread, in which time, the geſture of ſitting might haue beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. Thus it is not certaine, that they ſate at the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. If yee reply: it is not written that they did alter the geſture of ſitting: to that I anſwere before, and it is the Papiſts argument againſt the giuing of the Cup to the Layickes; it is not written, ſay they, that the Cup was giuen, in this place: Therefore, &amp;c. Alſo yee know, that the time of Chriſt his ſitting heere with his Diſciples at <hi>Emmaus,</hi> was the night ſeaſon, the place, a priuate Inne: that the breaking and giuing of that bread, was before or after another ordinary ſupper; and that onely men
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:26266:104"/>were there preſent, and not women: all which points be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certaine, according to your firſt reaſon, whereby yee intended to proue ſitting to haue been inſtituted; it will follow, that all theſe circumſtances, and things, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted to be obſerued as well as ſitting, becauſe our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour retained all theſe things, hauing no neceſſity at this time to celebrate the Sacrament. Thirdly, I ſay, if the Sacrament was here miniſtred, we haue an expreſſe war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for priuate Communion, which yee impugue: for Ieſus heere miniſtred vnto two onely, and yee will not content to haue it miniſtred to three. Laſtly, it is the iudgement of the learned <hi>Caluine,</hi> That there was no ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of the Sacrament at that time, and that Chriſt was knowne to theſe Diſclples by an ordinary prayer, which he vſed in bleſſing of the Table, and not by the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of the Sacrament: which opinion, he ſaith, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it ſeeme plauſible, is no more then a coniecture, which leanes to no probable reaſon. Then yee ſee, that it is vncertaine whether Chriſt gaue this Sacrament at <hi>Emmaus;</hi> and if he did, that there ſitting at the Receiuing is alſo vncertaine: And therby your argument is nought, and ſerueth only to eſtabliſh priuate Communion. Thus haue you gained nothing by this teſtimony, but loſt much.</p>

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:26266:104"/>of Diu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>els, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.21. Next, they ſate at the Loue feaſts: we cannot thinke, that they roſe from the Tables to receiue the Sacrament.</p>

                  <p>To proue that the Apoſtolike Church ſate at Table, you bring the compariſon, that the Apoſtle makes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the partaking of the Lords Table, and the table of Diuels: and the partaking of the table of Diuels, you ſay, was by a formall ſitting at table in the houſe of the Idoll: for which yee alledge <hi>Ionathan</hi> the Chaldee Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſt, vpon the eight verſe of the ſecond chapter of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos;</hi> but neither the Text, nor his interpretation proues the formall ſitting yee ſpeake of: for the text ſaith, they laid themſelues downe vpon clothes by euery Altar, and not, that they ſate: And the Paraphraſt, as <hi>Mercerus</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds him, ſaith, That thoſe clothes were <hi>Parapetaſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> that is, couerings or mattes, whereupon they laid themſelues downe, and not ſate, by euery Altar, and not in the Idols houſe. And for the place of the Apoſtle: <q>Yee cannot be partakers of the Table of the Lord, and of the table of Diuels,</q> there is no materiall or artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall table vnderſtood, either by the one Table or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and by participation, formall ſitting is not meant. This is manifeſt by theſe words, <hi>Yee cannot be partakers:</hi> for certaine it is, that they might haue ſitten formally at ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the houſe of the Idoll, and eaten of their ſacrifices, and might alſo haue ſitten at the Lords Table formally, and receiued the external elements. But the Apoſtle ſaith, That theſe two Tables, and the participation of them are ſo oppoſed, as they could not be partakers of both. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the table of Diuels in that place we vnderſtand the ſacrifices offered to Diuels, and by participation, we vnderſtand the eating of theſe ſacrifices, with a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence toward the Idoll, where euer it was done, whether in the Idols Temple, as 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.10. or in the priuate hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Idolaters, as 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.27.28. And by the Table of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:26266:105"/>the Lord, we vnderſtand the body and blood of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour in the Sacrament, and by the partaking of the Lords Table, the ſpirituall eating and drinking of his fleſh and bloud in the Sacrament, by a true and liuely faith. Theſe two Tables, and partakings could not ſtand together. And ſo by the Table of the Lord, the Apoſtle meanes not a material table, at which the Communicants ſate, but the body of Chriſt in the Sacrament. According to this <hi>Cauſabone</hi> in his Exercitations againſt <hi>Baronius,</hi> 16.36. citing theſe words, <hi>Non poteſtis menſae Dominiparticipes eſſe,</hi> &amp;c. ſaith, <hi>Hîc menſa Domini, eſt ipſa Euchariſtia, quam exemplo</hi> Pauli, <hi>Patresita ſaepè nominant.</hi> That is, The Table of the Lord in this place, is the Euchariſt it ſelfe, which the Fathers often call by this name of the table, following Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> example. Now where yee adde, that the people of Iſrael ſate downe to eate and drinke at the feaſt of the golden Calfe: I am aſſured, yee thinke not, that the Iſraelites had a materiall table, at which they ſate in that feaſt, ſo as their ſitting will make nothing for the formall ſitting; which yee would conclude. And for that which yee tell vs of the Loue feaſts, that people ſate at them, and that yee cannot thinke they roſe from the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to receiue the Sacrament; yee muſt know, that your thoughts are no probation: and whatſoeuer yee thinke, it is the Apoſtles expreſſe minde, that they who diſcerne not the body of the Lord from that, and all other carnall feaſts, are guilty of his body. And if yee thinke theſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly myſteries were worthily receiued, if after the ſame manner, and at the ſame time and table, they receiued without making diſcretion between the one feaſt and the other, yee thinke not according to the truth: <q>Nam hîc coena à myſterijs toto genere diuerſa erat:</q> as <hi>Cauſabone</hi> ſpeakes in the ſame booke of his Exercitations, 16.31. Then to conclude, neither haue yee proued that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, or Apoſtolike Church receiued the Sacrament ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting formally at a table; nor if they ſate, that their ſitting was exemplary: for

So all your following Diſcourſe is idle, and to no purpoſe; ſpecially where yee ſay, That ſitting was a cuſtome brought into the Church by Chriſt, whoſe example being ſeconded with the practiſe of the Apoſtles, is equiualent vnto a precept; and that it is ſafer for a mans conſcience
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:26266:106"/>to imitate Chriſt and his Apoſtles, then to depart from them, and imitate the cuſtome of Churches which may erre: for yee haue neither proued ſitting to be an Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like practiſe, not yet to be exemplary; and all your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons brought for that purpoſe, haue appeared to be of no force. Yet two things I note in this your anſwere: firſt yee ſay, That the Iewes did receiue their forme of ſitting from the Romanes and Perſians; and in this yee erre: for it is manifeſt, by the ſixt of <hi>Amos,</hi> That before they conuerſed either with Romanes or Perſians, that forme of geſture was vſed amongſt them. Next, when yee ſay, that there is little difference betweene the one faſhion of ſitting, and the other, that is alſo falſe: for it differeth as farre from our forme of ſitting, as lying doth: as is clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by theſe words of <hi>Amos</hi> 6.4. <hi>They Iye vpon beds of Iuory, and ſtretch themſelues vpon their couches.</hi> And by that verſe of IVVENAL <hi>Sat.</hi> 1.

                  <p>Whatſoeuer yee thinke, the faithfull will beleeue, that the Apoſtle ſetting downe, as hee doth in that place, the true forme of keeping the Lords Supper, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue omitted the geſture, if the ſame had been a part of the Inſtitution, and if he had receiued any thing tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching that from the Lord, he had without all queſtion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered the ſame to the Corinthians. As for your inſtance of a Table, if yee vnderſtand thereby a materiall table, appointed for feaſters to ſitte at, ſuch a table is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, as ſhalbe cleared in the anſwer to the ſecond breach:
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:26266:107"/>but if by a Table yee vnderſtand a commodious part, whereon the elements muſt bee placed, then the table muſt be reckoned amongſt the neceſſary circumſtance<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that accompany the action: for when Chriſt commanded to doe this, the command did inſinuate, That they muſt conuene in ſome place to doe it, that there muſt be a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor to giue, and ſome perſons to receiue; that the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are giuen and taken, muſt be placed in ſome commodious part, on which they may bee conſecrated with thankeſgiuing, and bleſſing, where they may bee broken, and where they may be giuen and receiued: ſuch a table is neceſſary, yet, what the matter, the forme, and quality of this table ſhould be, is no where expreſſed in the Scripture, but as the time when, and the place where, and the particular perſons to whom, and by whom the Sacrament ſhall bee celebrate: ſo the particular matter and forme of the Table is not mentioned in the Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but omitted with the reſt of the neceſſary circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and left to be determined by the Church, according to the rule of edification and decencie, and is onely inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated, as a thing neceſſarily enioyned with the actions preſcribed in the command: for when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>doe this,</hi> albeit he ſaith not, doe it at night, or in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or in a priuate or publike place, by ſuch a perſon and congregation, and ſuch a part or Table, or with ſuch ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture: yet the command imports, that it ſhould bee done at a conuenient time, in a conuenient place, by meete and qualified perſons, with a conuenient geſture, and on a conuenient Table, or on ſomewhat in ſtead of a Table. Now, what ſhould be conuenient in ſuch things, it could not be defined; for conueniency changes, according to times, ages and nations: The ſpecification thereof, is left to the wiſe iudgement of the Church, according to chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, <hi>quam ſi moderatricem patiemur,</hi> ſaith CALVIN, <hi>ſalua erunt omnia,</hi> that is, Charity being the moderatrix, all ſhal goe well.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond breach of the Inſtitution made by knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the act of receiuing, is the taking away the vſe of a table. Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſate at Table, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. Wherefore ſerueth the name of a Table, if wee keepe not the proper vſe, and employment of it? The Fathers call it the Lords Table, the heauenly Table, the ſacred Table, the myſticall Table, the ſpirituall Table, the rationall Table. Whereto ſerue all theſe commendations, if in the meane time it be not vſed as a Table, but rather as an Altar? if it be not vſed, as Chriſt and his Apoſtles vſed it, that is, by ſitting at it, to receiue the dainties ſet vpon the Table? <hi>And a little after;</hi> The people of God had an Altar for the Sacrifice, and a Table for a Feaſt. Such like the Ethnickes: ſo Chriſtians haue an Altar for a Sacrifice, to wit, Chriſt who is Prieſt, Altar, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.10. And a Table for the Feaſt, after this Sacrifice once made, to wit, the Sacrament of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. As the Iſraelites, and the Ethnickes ſate at the table of their feaſts, ſo doe we at our ſacred Feaſts, to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh betweene an Altar and a Table, a Sacrifice and a Supper made of the thing ſacrificed; a dreſſer or cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord may ſerue as well for the diſpoſing of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>I muſt take paines heere for clearing your minde, to draw your arguments together, which are ſet downe, <hi>tanquam ſcopa diſſoluta,</hi> as looſe or euill knit beeſomes: yee proue that kneeling taketh away the vſe of a table, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the proper vſe of a table is for ſitting. This yee qualifie, becauſe Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſate at Table: And becauſe the Iewes, and the Ethnickes ſate at their
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:26266:108"/>feaſts made of things ſacrificed. And this is your firſt argument: Your next is, becauſe ſitting makes a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction betweene an Altar and a Table, betweene a Supper and a Sacrifice. For anſwere to your firſt argument, I ſay, it is a meere caption, <hi>à fallacia conſequentis:</hi> for albeit that Chriſt and his Apoſtles, the Iewes and the Ethnicks ſate at their feaſts, it followeth not, that the proper vſe of a table is ſitting: The proper vſe of a table, is to hold and ſuſtaine the meat that is ſet thereon: beds in theſe dayes were ordained for ſitting, fourmes, chaires, and bonkers in our times: the taking away of ſitting, takes away the vſe of the beds, fourmes, and ſeates whereon they ſate, but not the vſe of the table: this ſtill remaines, if the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be placed thereon, and conſecrate in the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacrament, albeit no man ſitte thereat. As to Chriſt and the Apoſtles, the Iewes and the Ethnicks, they ſate at their feaſts, when they did eate their ſacrifices, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe feaſts were ſufficient bodily repaſts; at which they ſpent long time in eating, drinking, and conference: For the eaſe of their bodies, ſitting, lying, or ſuch like a geſture was neceſſary; but our Sacrament, which is wholly finiſhed, by receiuing a morſell of bread, and a very little wine, requires not a long time, nor ſuch an eaſefull geſture for the body. It is vncertaine, as I ſhewed before, what kinde of geſture our Sauiour and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles vſed; and if they ſate, it was occaſioned by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Supper, and no wiſe requiſite for the Sacrament, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for eaſe of the body, the action being quickly ended; neither for conference, for there was none vſed thereat: neither for receiuing the dainties, or the elements from the table, by ſtretching out their hands. As to the bread, <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaith, that the cuſtome was, of the Maſter of the feaſt, to breake the bread in ſo many peeces, as the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the feaſters were: and vnto euery one a peece was giuen, as great as an Oliue: or if yee reiect his authority, whom yee formerly cited in the booke of Diſcipline,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:26266:109"/>1560, which yee make the ground of your order, it is ſaid, the bread was broken by our Sauiour, and deliuered to him who ſate next, and that they brake, and deliuered each to his neighbour: Likewiſe that they diuided the cup amongſt them, after our Sauiour had giuen the ſame; ſo they ſtretched not forth their hands to take the elements from the table; and their ſitting at table for theſe ends was needleſſe.</p>
                  <p>To your ſecond argument I anſwere: the diſtinction of the Table from the Altar is not made by ſitting, but by the employments proper to them: The Altar was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the ſanctifying of the oblations made to God, the Table to hold and ſuſtaine ſuch things as are offered, and giuen to vs, according to Chriſts Inſtitution. The Prieſt ſtood at the Altar when he offered, and the people when they praied: ſo the Communicants in the Primitiue Church ſtood at the Table, when they receiued the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the Lords day, and this conformity in geſture tooke not away the difference between the Altar and the Table, as no more doth kneeling, or any other geſture. But to come to the ground, whereupon yee build this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yee ſay, the people of God had an Altar for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and a table for the feaſt: So Chriſtians haue Chriſt for the Altar and the Sacrifice, and a Communion Table for the Sacrament, which is their feaſt. This your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon hath ſome ſhew, but no ſolidity. There is a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence, I grant, betweene the Iewiſh Altar, and Chriſt, who was the Altar that did ſacrifice himſelfe, to be a Sacrifice for the ſinnes of the world; for the Iewiſh Altar was the type, and Chriſt the verity. But what cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence is there, betweene the tables whereon the Iewes did eate their ſacrifices, and the Communion Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? The tables whereon they did eate their ſacrifices, were not holy inſtruments, which appertained to the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle and Temple, but ſuch as they had in their owne priuate houſes; and therefore were not types, which did
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:26266:109"/>eyther ſignifie our Communion Tables, or whereunto our Communion Tables doe anſwere, as anti-types; for it is to be obſerued, that in Chriſtian Religion there is nothing which hath any neceſſary correſpondence, or relation to the Legall ceremonies, but that which is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the verity of ſome type, or the antitype of ſome type. As for example, betweene Chriſt, and the Leuitical Prieſt, the Altar, and the Sacrifice, there is relation as betweene the type and the verity: ſo betweene Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion and Baptiſme, the Paſſeouer and the Lords Supper, there is relation, as betweene the type and the antitype; for our Sacraments haue ſucceeded theſe, and are in their ſtead. But as to the Table, whereon the Paſſeouer and other ſacrifices were eaten, the ſame not being a ſacred inſtrument, or type appointed by God, as hath been ſaid, there is nothing in Chriſtian Religion anſwering thereto, either as the verity it ſelfe, or as an antitype ſucceeding thereto. As therefore their tables were not neceſſary for eating of their ſacrifices (for it is certaine, the Iewes were not aſtricted by any diuine ordinance to ſitte at Table, when they did eate the Paſſeouer, and their other Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) but were only commodious receptacles deuiſed by themſelues, which they might haue altered and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed as they thought meet: Euen ſo, a materiall arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall table for celebration of this Sacrament, is not an inſtrument appointed by our Sauiour, as the Altars and Tables of Shew-bread, but the ſame is appointed by the Church, according to that power which ſhee hath to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine circumſtances for the actions of diuine worſhip. To the diſpoſing of the elements, ſome ſuch receptacle and ſubiect is neceſſary, as a table, and decency requires it, when, and where the ſame may be had; but it is not of ſuch a neceſſary vſe, as the Altar vnder the Law, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Altar, a ſacrifice could not be offered, but without any ſuch table, the Sacrament hath often been miniſtred. <hi>Euagrius lib.</hi> 6. <hi>hiſt. cap.</hi> 13. records, That <hi>Gregorius</hi> Paſtor
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:26266:110"/>of <hi>Antiochia</hi> did miniſter the Sacrament to the Souldiers on the graſſe, before the 600. yeare of our Lord: at <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock-burne</hi> in the dayes of King <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> the like was done to the Scottiſh army on the fields, and ſo at many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times, when a table commodiouſly could not be had. Finally, where yee adde, That for diſpoſing of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, a dreſſer or cupboord may ſerue, theſe ſpeeches ſmell of profanity; as if to hold and ſuſtaine the elements were ſuch a baſe employment, that the inſtrument wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Church thought meet they ſhould be placed, ſhould neither be a table, nor named a table. And yet all theſe religious Epithets, which yee alledge the Fathers gaue to the Communion, as when they called it the Lords Table, the heauenly Table, the ſacred Table, &amp;c. were giuen to it, not becauſe the Communicants did ſitte thereat, or for any other geſture of body vſed by them, but becauſe the Lords body, the bread of heauen, the ſacred, myſticall, and ſpirituall food of our ſoules, were preſented thereon in the holy Sacrament. <hi>Cauſabone Exercit.</hi> 16.36. ſaith, That by theſe appellations, the Euchariſt it ſelfe was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. But heere it is manifeſt, that the Epithets in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriected in your diſcourſe, are not only impertinent, but repugnant to the opinion yee hold: For when yee aske, why is it called a table, if men ſit not at it? they anſwer you, Becauſe vpon that table, the heauenly, ſacred, and ſpirituall myſteries are ſet. In reſpect thereof, it is called a heauenly, ſpirituall, ſacred, and myſticall table. In the dayes of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Theodoret,</hi> by whom theſe Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets were moſt frequently giuen to the Sacrament, there was not a table in the Churches, at which men did ſitte, but one onely, on which the elements were placed, and conſecrate: but yee neuer fall vpon the name of a Table ſooner, then yee imagine it was appointed for ſitting. And what then thinke yee of the Table of Shew-bread, at which no man did ſit? Shall it not be called a Table, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it lacked your employment of ſitting, or table ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture?
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:26266:110"/>In all Reformed Churches of <hi>Europe,</hi> (our Church and very few excepted) the Communion Tables haue no employment, but only to hold, and ſuſtaine the elements: This is to be ſeen in the Churches of <hi>France, Germany, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary, Pole,</hi> and <hi>England.</hi> And in the <hi>Greeke</hi> Church <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabone</hi> obſerues, that there are two Tables, one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the elements are ſet before the Conſecration, and another wherupon they are Conſecrate. Thus haue I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently declared, that the only or chiefe vſe at leaſt of the Communion Table, is for the ſetting and diſpoſing of the elements, and the conſecration of them, with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of the ſame.

It is true, after the Sacrament is made by the ſacramentall word, theſe, or the like words are vttered by the Paſtor at the deliuery of the Elements, whereby the generall prayer and bleſſing, wherewith the action beginnes, is applyed particularly to euery Communicant, and they admoniſhed, and inſtructed to apply it to themſelues. This is the dutie both of the Paſtor and of the people: for as in the prayer it is our duetie to wiſh in generall, that all who are to participate the bodie and bloud of Ieſus, may be preſerued thereby to euerlaſting life: ſo it is our duetie to wiſh the ſame to each one ſeuerally at the inſtant when he is receiuing.

                  <p>If yee ſtand to that, which yee alleadge out of <hi>Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> was the cuſtome of the Iewes, and vſed by our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in the Inſtitution: yee haue no cauſe to quarrell the diſtribution of the bread; for the Maſter of the feaſt v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed to breake the berad in ſo many peeces as the number of the Feaſters were, giuing to euery one a peece: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did each perſon meaſure his owne portion, giuing the reſt to his neighbour, according to our cuſtome. But leauing this, if we ſhall conſider by the Inſtitution, what part is proper to the Paſtor, and what to the People, wee will finde, that as it is the Paſtors part to take bread, to bleſſe, and giue thanks; ſo is it his part, firſt, to breake the bread, then to giue it with this precept, <hi>Take, eate;</hi> and ſo, that it is the Peoples part not to breake it, but to take it broken: for, as it was the part of Chriſt, firſt, to giue his fleſh for the life of the World, when he did offer himſelfe in a ſacrifice for our ſinnes, which he will haue repreſented in the Sacrament by the Paſtor in breaking the bread: ſo it was his part to giue his fleſh to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, not to be broken and ſacrificed by them, but to bee eaten, after it was once broken &amp; ſacrificed by himſelfe. If therefore it be not the part of the people, either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the oblation of Chriſts body, or the donation thereof to vs, but the part of the Paſtor properly, who in theſe actions repreſents Chriſt, it cannot be the part of the people to breake the bread, nor to giue the bread one to another. For this cauſe, in the ancient Church, it was euer giuen, either by the Paſtor himſelfe, or by his Deacon, who ſupplied his place, and helped him in the action; but neuer by any of the people to others. And <hi>Clemens Alexandrmus</hi> in the place which your ſelfe quotes, ſaith not, that the people diuided the bread; but that it was permitted to euery one of the people to take a part of the Euchariſt, after that ſome (doubtleſſe the Maſters
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:26266:112"/>of the Church) had diuided it in peeces, as their cuſtome was. The learned <hi>Muſculus</hi> in his common places, <hi>De coena Domini, pag.</hi> 444. ſpeaking of this purpoſe ſaith; <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git &amp; dedit Diſcipulis ſuis, fregit ipſe manuſuapanem, ac fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum à ſe dedit Diſcipulis: non dedit integrum, &amp; ab ipſis fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendum, fed à ſe fractum panem. Non dedit vt ipſi diſtribuerent, fed vt à ſe diſtributum acciperent &amp; ederent. Erant Apoſtoli in ca coena Domini, non vt diſpenſatores myſteriorum Dei: ſed vt conuinae, vt fideles, vt Diſcipuli, vt Communicantes: Chriſtus verò vt Conuiuator, vt Dominus, eadem opera inſtituens, ac ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ipſius manibus diſpenſans gratiae ſuae ſacramentum.</hi> That is to ſay, Chriſt Ieſus brake, and gaue to his Diſciples: hee brake the bread with his owne hand, and when it was broken he gaue it to his Diſciples: he gaue it not whole vnto them, to be broken by them, but he gaue them that which he had broken: he gaue it not to them to be diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted by them, but that they ſhould take it being diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted by him, and eate it. The Apoſtles were in that Supper not as diſpenſers of the myſteries of God, but as Gueſts, as the faithfull, as Diſciples, and as Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants: but Chriſt was as the maker of the Feaſt, as the Maſter, at one time both inſtituting and diſpenſing with his owne hand the Sacrament of his grace. Here you ſee, that Chriſt is the breaker, the giuer, the diſtributer of the Bread, and not the Diſciples: And ſo the Paſtor is now the breaker, the giuer, the diſtributer, and not the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Let the judicious Reader conſider, whether the iudgement of this learned man doth better agree with the Inſtitution, or the opinion of the Pamphlet penner: And whether the Paſtor, who according to the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion breakes the bread, and giues it with his owne hands to the people, or they, who giue the bread to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in whole ſchaues to bee broken, and diſtributed by themſelues, comes neerer to Chriſts appointment.</p>
                  <p>But to come to the Cup: If our Sauiour, in giuing of the ſame, did imitate the cuſtome of the Iewes, which
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:26266:113"/>
                     <hi>Scaliger</hi> and others wrote to haue beene this; that the Maſter of the Feaſt, after he had bleſſed the Cup, did firſt drinke thereof himſelfe, and then gaue it to him who ſate next; ſo as it paſſed from hand to hand till all had drunken: it ſeemes, that the Diſciples did deliuer the Cup one to another. But there is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the diſtribution of the Cuppe and the Bread: for the diſtribution of the Bread is not a diuiding onely of the Bread from hand to hand, but a breaking is conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the diſtributing: for he that giues to his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, breakes before he giues. Now in this breaking we know there is a myſterie, which ſignifies the breaking of the Lords Body; which is an act, as is before made eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that onely appertaines to Chriſt, both in the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, when he did offer himſelfe on the Croſſe, and in the myſterie, when he did repreſent his oblation, or the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his body, by the breaking of the bread: and therefore is ſuch an act, as ought onely to be performed by him, who in the Sacrament acteth the part of Chriſt, and repreſents him ſacrificing himſelfe. In diſtribution of the Cuppe there is no ſuch myſterie: for the giuing of it from hand to hand ſignifies not the ſhedding of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours bloud, but the taking of the Cup by the Paſtor, and the drinking thereof, doth repreſent that Cup which the Father propined to his Sonne, and the Sonne receiued and dranke, when willingly hee ſuffered his bloud to bee ſhed on the Croſſe for the remiſſion of the ſinnes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and for confirmation of the new Teſtament; which Cup, Bloud, and Teſtament, is in the Sacrament deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the People by the Paſtor in Chriſts name, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them to take, and drinke all thereof. He in whoſe Name this command is vttered, is properly the Giuer and propiner, becauſe by his authoritie it is giuen, and by the warrant of his word it is receiued. When the King drinks to any of his Subiects, and ſends it by the hand of his ſeruant, the ſeruant is not properly the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:26266:113"/>giuer and propiner, but the deliuerer of the gift and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine: and therefore, as in the Sacrament, the Paſtor when he takes the Cup, and drinks, acteth the part of Chriſt, and repreſents him taking and drinking that moſt bitter Cuppe of his Paſſion and death for our ſinnes: ſo, when he giues and commands the people to take, and drinke all thereof, he acteth the part of Chriſt, applying his bloud, and giuing the New Teſtament confirmed thereby to euery worthy receiuer, whether the ſame be deliuered immediately to euery one by his owne hand; or if it bee ſent by the hand of the Deacon, as is was in the Primitiue Church, or if it be deliuered from hand to hand by the Communicants amongſt themſelues. But without all queſtion, if the Paſtor may commodiouſly by himſelfe make the deliuery, it is moſt agreeable to the perſon which hee carries in that holy action, who repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents our Sauiour, firſt, willingly vndergoing death for vs, then, moſt bountifully applying it to vs with his owne hand.</p>
                  <p>O, but in the 22. of <hi>Luke, verſe</hi> 17. our Sauiour ſayd, <hi>Take this Cuppe, and diuide it amongſt you:</hi> The word is,
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Part it amongſt you. Here you trouble your ſelfe, and the Reader much with a long diſcourſe, prouing that in this place the Euchariſticke Cuppe, and not the Paſchall is meant: Yet let it be ſo. What then? they are commanded to part it amongſt them, <hi>ergo,</hi> to reach it from hand to hand. This followes not; for when euery one takes his owne part of that which is to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they diuide the whole amongſt them, although eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one deliuer not with his hand to his neighbour the thing which is to be diuided, or the remanent thereof: as by example; When the Manna, which was gathered in the Wilderneſſe, was caſt together in heapes, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies came forth, and parted the ſame amongſt them, euery man taking his Homer, which was his part; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies diuided the whole amongſt them, without reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:26266:114"/>from hand to hand the heape which was diuided: ſo when the Diſciples were commanded to diuide the Cup amongſt them, if euery one did drinke no more then his owne portion, &amp; did leaue the reſt to his fellow, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was obeyed: albeit when euery one had drunken, the laſt had ſet downe the Cup on the Table, or had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered it into his hand, from whom he had receiued it; or if one or two had beene maymed, and lacked the vſe of their hands, ſo that the Cup behoued to be holden to their heads; yet if they dranke no more, but their owne part, with reſpect to their neighbour, who was to drinke after them, they diuided the Cup: for the diuiding is not the giuing of the Cup, but the parting of the wine amongſt them, that was in the Cup: So if they did drinke with ſuch moderation, that one, two, or three dranke it not all, but that all did drinke as our Sauiour commanded; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they did not deliuer it one to another, but receiued it ſeuerally, euery one from Chriſts owne hand, as wee doe out of the hand of the Paſtor, they neuertheleſſe diuided the ſame amongſt them. To conclude, the command gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the Apoſtles, importeth, that <hi>Poculum beneditionis,</hi> is not <hi>Poculum ebrietatis, fed charitatis,</hi> that is to ſay, The Cup of bleſſing, is not the cup of drunkenneſſe, but the Cup of charity, which ſhould not be carowſed by one, but ſhould be parted amongſt many. And therefore theſe two phraſes, the one vſed by Saint LVKE, <hi>Diuide it amongſt you:</hi> and the other by S. MATTHEVV and S. MARKE, <hi>Drinke thereof all, and they dranke of it all,</hi> are equiualent. As to the giuing and deliuering of the Cup, whether it ſhould be, by the hand of the Paſtor, or by the mutuall deliuering of the people one to another, becauſe it is not defined by the Scripture, it is indifferent, and left to bee determined by the Church.</p>
                  <p>Theſe grounds being ſure, let vs conſider your ſyllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme: Whatſoeuer action or command is incloſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Inſtitution, may not lawfully be broken. But that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:26266:114"/>the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municants ſhould diſtribute amongſt themſelues, was both an action at the firſt Supper, and a precept, as hath been proued; Therefore kneeling by conſequence is diſcharged. By what conſequence I pray you? Becauſe, ſay you, that geſture, and this diſtribution, is no wayes compatible. It is a manifeſt vntruth; for he that kneeles, may take as well his portion of the wine, and leaue the reſt to his neighbour, as he that ſittes; and if you thinke that one cannot reach, and deliuer the Cup to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour kneeling beſide him, you are deceiued: for I haue ſeene at one daies ſeruice a thouſand perſons, who haue reached the Cup one to another kneeling, as they were accuſtomed to doe ſitting at Table before: yet, as hath been ſaid, that was not neceſſary, for the precept in the Inſtitution is not, <hi>Giue this Cup one to another,</hi> but <hi>diuide it,</hi> or <hi>part it amongſt you,</hi> or <hi>drinke all thereof.</hi>

                  <p>The ſacramental Supper ſhould carry the reſemblance of a Supper, in the formes and faſhions thereof, or elſe it cannot rightly be called a Supper: for it is not onely the matter, that is, the dainties and food that makes a ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, but alſo the ordering of the gueſts, and kindly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of them.</p>

                  <p>It is true, that it cannot properly be called a Supper, except it carry the reſemblance of a Supper, both in the dainties, and in the formes and faſhions of a ſupper; but it may be called a ſupper rightly, as yee ſpeake, although it doe not reſemble a ſupper in all theſe things. For that which is properly called a ſupper, hath plenty and varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of meat and drinke, at leaſt it is a ſufficient bodily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:26266:115"/>Secondly, at it ſo much time is ſpended, as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the entertainment. Thirdly, the Gueſts doe entertaine one another by caruing, and drinking, and other kindly and familiar communication. Fourthly, The time thereof is the euening or night ſeaſon. I am aſſured, that the Sacrament, for any reſemblance it hath in any of theſe things to a ſupper, cannot properly be called a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, farre leſſe in reſpect of ordering, and entertaining the Gueſts. For at ordinary ſuppers, Gueſts are ordered according to their qualities, but heere there is no reſpect of perſons: for entertainment, Gueſts are entreated <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixè,</hi> that is, largely and long; but heere, more then ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly, for the bodily part, with a morſell of bread, and a little wine. Theſe being laid aſide, what are your table and ſitting thereat, but idle ſpectacles? Yee breake, and giue the bread one to another: that wee haue ſhewed to be againſt the Inſtitution; yee drinke one to another, but we ought not to drinke one to another, as the giuer and propiner drinkes to the receiuer: for our Sauiour onely, who is repreſented by the Paſtor, is the giuer and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piner of the Cuppe externally, and of his owne bloud in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally; and all the people are but receiuers, not giuers or propiners in any wiſe. And as to our Communion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt our ſelues, it ſtandeth not in this, That wee haue any fellowſhip in diſpenſation of the ſacred myſteries, but it ſtandeth in the participation alonely: not in this, that we take the bread, breake, and giue it to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but in this, that we all receiue the ſame bread, which is broken by the Paſtor, and the ſame fleſh which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour did breake vpon the Croſſe: ſuch like not in that we take the Cup, drinke, and giue it one to another; but in this, that we drinke all of the ſame Cup, which the Paſtor giues after thankeſgiuing; and the ſame bloud which our Sauiour ſhed for the ſinnes of many; otherwiſe, if wee confound the actions of the Paſtor and the people, wee breake and violate the Inſtitution, and diſturbe the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:26266:116"/>whole action, making the people not only act their owne part, but alſo take vpon them the part of Chriſt, and the Paſtor. We muſt not therefore ſeeke the reſemblance of the Supper in theſe things, that are manifeſtly repugnant to the Inſtitution, but in ſuch things, as are contained therein</p>
                  <p>Go too then, and let vs take a view of theſe: firſt, in the Inſtitution a ſupper is reſembled by a ſufficient repaſt, not in the quantity, but in the nature and quality of the elements, the one being drie, the other wette; the one meate, the other drinke, in which two kindes a perfect food conſiſts; to teach vs, that in Chriſt is all fulneſſe: <hi>He that comes to me ſhall neuer hunger, And he that beleeues in me, ſhall neuer thirſt.</hi> Secondly, a Supper is reſembled in the Sacrament; by the bleſſing and diſtribution that is made by the Maſter of the feaſt, and by taking, eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Gueſts, which are the eſſentiall parts, and properties of a Supper. Thirdly, as a ſupper is not the repaſt of ſome few, but of the whole family and gueſtes, who are preſent; for which cauſe it was called <hi>coena tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, becauſe it was common: So is the Sacrament inſtituted for all that are preſent, who may, and will come and preſent themſelues therto. Theſe are the things ſet downe in the Inſtitution, wherein the reſemblance ſtands. Your table prerogatiues, geſtures, formes, faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ordering and entertainment of gueſtes, we find not, and therefore dare not bee ſo bold, as to affirme them to be neceſſary. As in extending the ſenſe of Parables, a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration would be kept, that it be not racked beyond the bounds and ſcope of the purpoſe, whereupon the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is inferred: ſo the parabolicke names giuen to theſe holy myſteries, ſhould not bee extended beyond the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance &amp; ſimilitude ſet downe in Scripture, for which theſe names are impoſed. Therefore when the Sacrament is called a Table, and a Supper, wee muſt not thinke that euery thing which is competent to an ordinary table, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:26266:116"/>ſupper, are to be found and obſerued there, but only ſuch as haue cleare warrant in the Inſtitution, either in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, or by neceſſary conſequence. In particular, the whole ſubſtantiall things, actions, and ceremonies are expreſſed, from the which wee ſhould take nothing, and whereunto we ſhould adde nothing. The circumſtances that doe neceſſarily accompany ſuch things, actions, and ceremonies, as the time when, the place where, the part whereon, the perſon by whom, and to whom, and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, doe neceſſarily follow the action: for ſome time and place muſt be, when, and where it muſt be done; ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons by whom, and to whom it muſt be celebrated; ſome part there muſt be, whereon the elements muſt be ſet, and from whence they muſt be giuen and receiued; ſome poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſite of body muſt be vſed by the giuers, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuers, and ſome order muſt be obſerued for entring and proceeding in the action and finiſhing therof: ſome things would go before, as Sermons or Seruice; and it is decent, that the celebration be cloſed with Pſalmes and bleſſings: but none of theſe circumſtantiall things are particularly defined by Scripture, therefore they are left to bee deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the Church, according to the rules of edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, order, and decencie.</p>

That when the people brought their oblations, they bowed. As to the eating of it, the ſame was in priuate houſes, and did ſerue them for an ordinary ſupper; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was it to be receiued accordingly.

                  <p>This all is ſound, and touching it, wee agree fully with you, that reuerence which is done to the Sacrament ſhould not bee expreſſed by kneeling, which you truely call a geſture of adoration, and ſoueraigne worſhippe. Therefore ſhould it neither bee giuen to the booke of the Euangell, nor to the elements of the Sacrament, but to him only, who is the Author, and matter of both. And yet if men fall downe, and worſhip him at the hearing of the Goſpell, or after, at the receiuing of the Sacrament, or after, and before it be receiued, being moued thereto by contemplation of his grace, and glory in the one and other: this religious worſhip no man wil deny to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully performed, as well by the worthy receiuer of the Sacrament, as by the reuerent hearer of the Word; for as we bow not to the letters and ſyllables, and ſounds of the words of the Goſpell, but to him, whoſe minde and will is declared therein: So doe wee not bow to the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of bread and wine in the Sacrament, but to him, whoſe body and bloud we receiue thereby. But you, to make the world beleeue, that the Churches of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> kneele to the elements of bread and wine in the Sacrament, at leaſt haue ordained ſo to be done: you alledge againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the Miniſters of <hi>Lincolne</hi> their defence in the third part thereof, referring the Reader to their proofes; touching which part, I only reply this, that there be ſufficient anſweres made to theſe proofes, by learned and reuerend men in that Church,

For the Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> I anſwere ſhortly, That he takes the myſteries with <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> for the body and blood of Chriſt, repreſented in the Sacrament by the elements of bread and wine. In which ſenſe, they are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called great and dreadfull, and ought to bee receiued with great humility of ſoule, and humiliation of body: <hi>Non enim peccatur adorando carnem Chriſti, ſed peccatur non

But that your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit may be manifeſted, I will ſet downe the act, as it is extracted forth of the Regiſter of the Aſſembly, vnder the hand of the Clerke thereof.</p>

The firſt reaſon is, <hi>Since we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God himſelfe, that when we come to worſhip him, wee fall downe, and kneele before the Lord our Maker.</hi> Relatiue vnto this, we haue in the concluſion, <hi>Therefore in reuerence of God, the Aſſembly thinkes good, that the Sacrament be giuen to the people kneeling.</hi> The ſecond reaſon in the narratiue is, <hi>And conſidering withall, that there is no part of diuine worſhip more heauenly and ſpirituall, then is the holy receiuing of the bleſſed bodie and blood of our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Relatiue to this, wee haue theſe words, <hi>And in due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card of ſo diuine a myſterie.</hi> Wee ſay not in regard of the diuine myſteries, which you interpret the elements, but <hi>Myſterie,</hi> that is, the holy receiuing of the body and blood of Ieſus Chriſt, mentioned in the narratiue. Our third reaſon is, the correſpondence which ought to be
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:26266:120"/>betweene the outward geſture of our body, and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, and lifting vp of our hearts, when we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and conſider the myſticall vnion betweene Chriſt and vs, and amongſt our ſelues, whereof we are made partakers by receiuing of Chriſts bleſſed body and bloud. This is expreſſed in theſe words, <hi>Like as the moſt humble and reuerent geſture of the body in our meditation, and lifting vp of our hearts, becomes ſo diuine and ſacred an action.</hi> Relatiue to this, in the concluſion, we haue theſe words; <hi>And in remembrance of ſo myſticall an vnion, as we are made partakers of thereby:</hi> for this <hi>remembrance</hi> is a part of our medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So to conclude, we come to worſhip at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Lord our Maker, who hath not onely made vs by creation, but who by redemption hath made vs his people, and the ſheepe of his paſture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.7. <hi>Pſalme</hi> 100.3. that is, God manifeſted in the fleſh. We come to receiue his fleſh and bloud, and in reuerence of him wee are commanded by the act to kneele. As yee then inferre vpon your forgery and falſhood, that to kneele for reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the myſteries is nothing elſe, but to worſhip the myſteries: ſo I inferre vpon the very words wherein the act is conceiued, That to kneele for reuerence of God, in due regard of the diuine myſterie, that is, the receiuing of Chriſts body and bloud, in remembrance of the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call vnion, whereof thereby we are made partakers, firſt, with our Head and Sauiour; and next, through him, with God, and amongſt our ſelues: to kneele, I ſay, at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament for the reuerence and reſpects aforeſayd, is to worſhip God rightly, and that is the due obſeruation of his commandement.</p>

               <head>The Doctrine of Papiſts, touching the honour of Images.</head>
               <p>THe Papiſts profeſſe, that they giue to their Images two kindes of honour: The one they call Proper,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:26266:121"/>the other Accidentall and improper. The proper, they ſay, is due to the Image, as it is an holy thing, ſuch as the honour which is giuen to the Euangell, to holy Veſſels and Veſtures; and it is proper, becauſe it reſts in the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, as in the proper obiect, and is not conueyed by the Image immediately to the principall and archetype, albeit it be giuen to the Image, for the reſpect and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which is carryed to the principall, and ſo by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence redounds to the principall. This honour they affirme to differ, not in ſpecie, but in degree onely from the honor which is properly due to the principall. <hi>Bellar. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Imag. cap.</hi> 21. <hi>&amp;</hi> 25.</p>
               <p>Before wee proceede to the improper and accidentall adoration of Images, we haue here to conſider, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit no honour, but contempt, and deſtruction onely be due to Papiſticall Images, becauſe they are not holy things, but deteſtable abominations: yet therefore we muſt not thinke, that to ſuch things as are truely holy, and applyed to religious vſes, reuerent and religious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect is not due, as to the holy Sacraments, and to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangell, which honor reſts in them, and is giuen to them in reſpect of him, whoſe word and Sacraments they are, and ſo redounds to him conſequently: ſuch an honour I meane, as is the hearing of the Word reuerently, and the handling of the Sacraments, with the preſeruing, and vſing of them decently. It is true, this honour is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a ſpece of adoration, but a religious reuerence onely, which we muſt not reiect, becauſe the Papiſts giue the ſame, or the like, to their Idols: for they giue to things which are not religious, but ſuperſtitious, and execrable, a religious honour: therefore this reaſon is a meere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, wherwith ye abuſe the ſimple. Papiſts giue ſuch honor to their Idols, and in ſo doing they commit idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: therefore ſincere Profeſſors in giuing that honor to the Sacraments &amp; the word, commit idolatry. It followes not, for Papiſts giue the honor which is due to the Word
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:26266:122"/>and Sacraments vnto their Idols, to which it no wiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs: as by example; Papiſts vſe their Images for ſignes, meanes, and occaſions to ſtirre them vp to worſhippe God, and in this they commit idolatry, becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, vſe, and handle them as holy things, which God hath not allowed to be done: but when a true Chriſtian vſeth the Word of God, and the Sacraments for ſignes, middeſſe, occaſions, and inſtruments to ſtirre him vp to worſhip God, and in that reſpect honours and reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces them as holy things, hee doth not commit idolatry, nor breakes not the ſecond Commandement: but by the contrary he obſerues that Commandement, in vſing the meanes, which God himſelfe hath ordayned to be vſed in his worſhip: and hee obſerues the third Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which bindes all men to ſanctifie the Name of God, and ſuch meanes as he hath vouchſafed to manifeſt himſelfe by to vs in his worſhip.</p>
               <p>Now I proceede to the accidentall and improper ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which Papiſts profeſſe themſelues to giue to their Images. This is the point here moſt controuerted, and therefore moſt expedient to be knowne.</p>
               <p>The accidentall honour which they gine to their Images is, an adoration of their Images coniunctly with the principall; as when the King is honoured, his Robe Royall, and all his Ornaments are honoured coniunctly with his perſon, and with the ſame ſignes of honour that are giuen to his perſon: <hi>Bellarm. ibidem cap</hi> 20. <hi>&amp;</hi> 23.</p>
               <p>The improper honour is the adoration of the Image in place, and ſtead of the principall: as, when the Prince his Ambaſſadour is honored for the Prince himſelfe; or, an empty Coffin or Image, for the perſon himſelfe, whoſe Image it is; all the honour due to the Prince, is done in that caſe to the Ambaſſadour or Image; as beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, kneeling, diſcouering of the head, proſtration of the body, kiſſing, enbracing, and burning of Incenſe, &amp;c. <hi>Bellarm. ibidem.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:26266:122"/>
               <p>The improper, and accidentall honour, or adoration, differs from the proper: firſt, becauſe the proper, as they ſay, although it be the ſame in ſpecie, with that which is giuen to the principall, yet it differs from it in degree; but this improper honour is the ſame, both in ſpecie and in degree. Next, becauſe the proper, as they ſay, <hi>termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur,</hi> that is, ends and reſts in the Image, and redounds not immediately to the principall, but by way of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. The improper, and accidentall adoration, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be done to the Image, <hi>non tamen terminatur,</hi> yet it ends not, and reſts in the Image, but paſſes, and is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately conueyed to the principall by the Image, and from the Image. <hi>Bellarm. ibid. cap.</hi> 21. <hi>&amp;</hi> 25.</p>
               <p>This is ſummarily their doctrine, as may bee ſeene in their Writings. To apply this to our purpoſe, yee labour to extenuate this adoration, which they profeſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to giue vnto their Images accidentally and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, ſaying, that the externall ſignes of adoration, ſuch as kneeling, bowing, diſcouering of the head, &amp;c. are onely done before them, and about them. This is too ſparingly and raſhly ſpoken: for theſe externall ſhewes are not onely done before and about them, but the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall adoration is wholy exhibited to them. <hi>Bellarmine lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Imag. cap.</hi> 23. writeth thus: <hi>Aliquando imago ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitur pro ipſo exemplari, &amp; eaquae fierent circa ipſum exemplar ſi adeſset praeſens, fiunt circa imaginem, mente tamen defixam exemplari: ſic concionatores alloquuntur imaginem crucifixi, ei<expan>

So Preachers direct their ſpeech to the Image of the Crucifiex, and ſay vnto it, Thou redeemedſt vs, thou reconciledſt vs to the Father. And a little after, in the ſame place he ſaith; <hi>Aliquando
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:26266:123"/>non accipimus imaginem pro exemplari, nec conſideramus ſolam imaginem, vel ſolum exemplar, ſed confideremus exemplar, vt obiectiue relucet in imagine, &amp; ipſum ſic repraſentatum &amp; qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi veſtitum imagine veneramur: tunc autem neceffario adoramus imaginem, codem cultu, quo ipſum exemplar:</hi> That is to ſay, Sometimes the Image is not taken for the exemplar, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſider we the Image by it ſelfe alone, nor the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplar by it ſelfe alone: but wee conſider the exemplar as an obiect ſhining in the Image, and ſo we adore the exemplar it ſelfe repreſented, and cloathed as it were with the Image: then of neceſſitie wee adore the Image with the ſame worſhip wherewith we adore the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall.

Hence it is manifeſt, that the ſignes of honour, which are done before them, and about them, are exhibited to them: they kiſſe them, they ſpeake to them, they kneele, they fall downe, they diſcouer their heads to them, and all is done about them, that would be done about Chriſt; all is
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:26266:123"/>done to them, that would bee done to Chriſt, as if hee were preſent in perſon. This is the profeſſed and auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched doctrine of the Papiſts, which yee, as a deceiuer, go about to extenutae. So, to conclude this point, that by the act at <hi>Perth</hi> we are ordained to bow our knees to the Elements of bread and wine in the Sacrament, or that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch honour, or ſigne of adoration is done to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament by vs, as Papiſts grant they giue to their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, is a moſt impudent lye.</p>

Yet all of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in one voice, &amp; the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> confeſſe, that they exhibite to the Images all the externall reuerence &amp; ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which is due to the principall; and that they adore the Image, either in liew of Chriſt, or coniunctly with him, as the robe and veſture wherein hee is clothed, and ſhines. Their externall adoration therfore is not abſtract from their Images, but our externall and internall both are abſtract. For we are no more enioyned by the act to bow our knee to the ſacramentall Elements,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:26266:125"/>then to fixe our minds vpon them, &amp; worſhip them in our hearts. Alſo, when <hi>Suarez</hi> calleth the Image an occaſion, a middeſſe, a ſigne, ſtirring vp a man to adore the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, he neither ſaies, nor meanes, that the Image ſhould not be adored externally with that ſame worſhip which is due to the principal.

                  <p>I haue ſhewed, &amp; ſhall preſently ſhew, by Gods grace, the difference in this caſe to bee as great, as is betweene idolatry, and the true worſhip of God. Firſt, It is idolatry to vſe any Image in the worſhip of God, for a ſigne, an occaſion, or a middeſſe to ſtir vp a man to worſhip God; for they are prohibited in the ſecond Comandement, and by the Prophet they are called Teachers of lyes, becauſe by them properly and truly, nothing can be brought to our remembrance, for which we ſhould adore God: but on the other part, it is not poſſible that either our mindes can be informed to know God, or our affections moued to worſh ippe him, except by the contemplation of the creatures, the meditation of the Word, and the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:26266:125"/>of the holy Sacraments: take theſe occaſions, middeſſe, and ſignes away, yee aboliſh Religion, and all the worſhip of God out of the Word. I hope the Reader by this ſhall ſee the difference to bee as great in this caſe, as is betweene a lawfull meane of Gods worſhip, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by himſelfe, and the inuention of man prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God.</p>
                  <p>Next, the Papiſts will haue theſe middeſſe, occaſions, &amp; ſignes not onely obiects of diuine worſhip actiue, that is, ſeruing to ſtir vp, and moue men to worſhip, which is the firſt degree of their idolatry: but they will haue them likewiſe paſſiue obiects, ſuch as are to be worſhipped ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſtead of the principall, or coniunctly with him; &amp; this is a higher degree of idolatry. In this then they differ alſo from the Word, Sacraments, &amp; creatures, that theſe being the ordinary obiects &amp; inſtruments whereby men muſt be ſtirred vp to worſhip God, &amp; ſo the obiects of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine adoration actiuely, they neither are, nor ſhould they be eſteemed paſſiue obiects of adoration, that is, ſuch as ſhould be adored, either coniunctly with God, or in his ſtead. This we condemne &amp; deteſt, yet muſt not run on with you to the other extremity, &amp; ſay, that howſoeuer they were ordained of God to be ſignes &amp; ſeales of his graces, yet they are not <hi>in ſtatu acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modato ad adora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>du<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> for although by them, &amp; before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that is, (to make the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities which ye affect, plaine) albeit they ſhould neither be adored in place of God &amp; his Son; or coniunctly with God &amp; his Son, as the Papiſts profeſſe to adore their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: yet certaine it is, that there is nothing in nature, or religion fit &amp; apt to ſtirre men vp to worſhip God, if the Sacraments be not meet. Shall our corporall food, when it is preſented on table before vs, bee in ſuch ſtate, as is proper to ſtir vs vp to worſhip God with thankſgiuing &amp; praier? Shall the conſideration of the benefit which we haue by the light of the day, &amp; by our reſt &amp; ſleepe in the night, be eſteemed motiues of ſuch moment, that he who
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:26266:126"/>is not thereby moued in the morning when he riſeth, and at night when he goeth to bed, to pray, and giue thanks, is eſteemed a ſlothfull and ingratefull Chriſtian? Shall a ſeaſonable ſeede time, ſhall the firſt and latter raine, and a faire harueſt bee pregnant occaſions to remember vs both in priuate and publike to giue thanks, and praiſe God for his goodneſſe? And ſhall the bleſſed Sacrament of the body and bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, in the very act, when it is in giuing and receiuing, not be eſteemed to be in proper ſtate to moue vs, and ſtirre vp our hearts to pray, and giue thanks for that ineſtimable benefite, euen when our Sauiour hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded that we ſhould do this in remembrance of him? It is an abſurd opinion. Then to conclude; If yee hold theſe two points which ye haue propounded, to wit, that the Sacrament, and creatures of God ſhould not be vſed as occaſions, middeſſes, and ſignes to moue vs by the fight and meditation of them, to liſt vp our hearts to the ſpirituall obiect of our ſaith, that is, to God in Ieſus Chriſt, becauſe <hi>Suarce</hi> ſaith, that their Images haue that vſe; then certainely, you muſt hold, that God ſhould not bee knowne nor worſhipped in the World: for without this vſe of the Word, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Creatures, God cannot bee knowne, nor worſhipped. So whilſt yee flye idolatry, yee fall into A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme. Next, if yee hold, that the Sacraments in the very act of the adminiſtration, are not <hi>in ſtatu accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to adadorandum,</hi> you muſt take away the chiefe and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall ende of the Sacrament commended to vs by the Lord himſelfe in theſe words, <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me.</hi> Saiut <hi>Paul</hi> interprets theſe words thus; <hi>So often as yee eate this bread, and drinke of this Cuppe, yee ſhall declare the Lords death, till he come againe:</hi> that is, as the Confeſſion of our faith, which yee haue ſworne and ſubſcribed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines it, <hi>Yet ſhall extoll, magnifie, and prayſe his death</hi> Now this is a reall act of adoration, which both the Lord himſelfe, and his holy Apoſtle would haue vs moued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:26266:126"/>by this Sacrament. So by theſe your poſitions and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions, yee mutilate the Sacrament of one of the moſt principall ends, for the which it was inſtituted. And ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally yee take from the Creatures of God, and the holy Sacraments, the moſt excellent vſe, for which they were appointed: namely, to be meanes and motiues to ſtirre vs vp vnto the worſhip of our Creator and Redeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>

                  <p>We allow no worſhip, whether it be relatiue, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, that is either giuen to Sacrament or Creature. But it is a groſſe error to thinke that the worſhip which is onely giuen to God immediately, or directly, is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, becauſe it is motioned, and occaſioned by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Gods Creatures, and bleſſed Sacraments: for ſo all the worſhip of God muſt be relatiue, becauſe it is all occaſioned either by the Word, the Sacraments, or the Creatures: whereas, indeede, there is no worſhip relatiue, but that which is giuen to ſome mediate thing, for the relation it hath to the principall: and as for vs, wee neyther giue to the Word, the Sacrament, or any Creature, diuine worſhip, but onely to God, whom by the Word, the Sacrament, and the Creatures wee are taught and admoniſhed to worſhip. The relatiue wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:26266:127"/>is onely that which Papiſts giue to their Idols, for the relation they haue to the principall, which we deteſt, and condemne as much as your ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Where you ſay, that the ſignes of the olde and new Teſtament, and the ſacramentall Elements, when they are onely ſeene, as likewiſe the Sunne, or any beautifull creature, might then moue vs to adore: I anſwere, that although they be potentially <hi>obiectu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> à quo,</hi> obiects where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may bee ſtirred vp to worſhip; yet are they not actually ſuch, except they bee applyed, and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date to that vſe, either in the ordinary publique miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, or in a mans priuate meditation and deuotion: or extraordinarily vpon ſome preſent and great occaſion; as when the fire came downe at the prayer of <hi>Elias,</hi> and conſumed the ſacrifice. When the Signes, Sacraments, or Works of God, are after that manner propounded and inſinuated, they are <hi>in ſtatu accommodato adorandum,</hi> and then men ought to adore and worſhip God: yet it is not neceſſary that they ſhould, vpon all ſuch occaſions, fall downe and kneele, as yee conclude: For when in our priuate meditation and deuotion, or when by ſome preſent great occaſion, wee are inwardly moued and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to worſhip; our externall geſture of adoration is arbitrarie, and leſt to our owne priuate election, to doe what is moſt conuenient &amp; decent for that time: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time the diſcouering of the head is ſufficient, ſometime the liſting vp of the eyes onely, and ſometime no geſture at all is required; but in the ordinary Miniſterie, when the works of God, or his benefites are propounded, and applyed publikely, to ſtirre vs vp to worſhip in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of the Church, then our geſture ceaſeth to bee arbitrarie: for it muſt be ſuch as is preſcribed and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the Church, where we worſhip. So, when by the ſight of the Sacraments onely, or by the ſight of holy ſignes, or creatures of God, wee are moued priuately to worſhippe, wee may vſe, or not vſe, what ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:26266:127"/>we thinke meeteſt; yet when we come to the table our ſelues, not to be ſpectators, but to communicate with others, we ought to receiue, and worſhip after the forme and cuſtome of that Church in which we are. If they ſit with their heads diſcouered, ſo ſhould we: If they ſtand or paſſe by, ſo ſhould we: If they kneele, ſo ſhould wee for vniformity and peace ſake.

                  <p>Your former diſpute was founded on falſchood, this runnes all vpon ambiguity of ſpeech. To kneele before the Elements hath two ſenſes, either it ſignifies to kneele to the Elements, as wee are ſaid to kneele before God, when we kneele vnto him; and Papiſts before their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, when they kneele to them. In this ſenſe, it is a lye to affirme, that we kneele before the Elements. Next, to kneele before any thing, ſignifieth to kneele, hauing ſome things before our eyes, or in our ſight, or obiect to our ſenſes either by caſuall poſition, as you ſay, or purpoſely. To kneele to God before any thing, ſtanding, or ſet caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally before you, you doe not condemne; but to kneele to God, hauing any thing purpoſely before vs, as the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:26266:128"/>Elements, that yee inſinuate to be idolatrie, but I hope you ſhal neuer proue it: for a Penitentiary kneeles to God purpoſely before the Congregation, and with a reſpect to the Congregation; namely, that they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre with him in prayer, he may teſtifie to them his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained repentance, and they being ſatisfied therewith, may receiue him againe into their fellowſhip. Heere is a kneeling to God before ſomething purpoſely, and with reſpect, which is not idolatrie. When wee come to our common tables, before we eate, either ſitting with our heads diſcouered, or ſtanding, or kneeling, we giue thanks and bleſſe with a reſpect to the meat, which is purpoſely ſet on table; yet this is not idolatry. And to draw ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what nearer to the purpoſe: The Paſtor, when he begins the holy action, hath the bread and the cup ſet before him purpoſely vpon the table, and with reſpect to them hee giues thankes to God, for that it hath pleaſed him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the Sacrament in theſe Elements, that hee might thereby communicate to vs, the body and the blood of Ieſus. And thus hee ought to bleſſe the Elements, for which the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The Cup of his bleſſing which wee bleſſe, is it not the Communion of the blood of Chriſt?</hi> Heere is a praying, a bleſſing, a thankeſgiuing to God before the Elements, purpoſely ſet before vs, and not by caſuall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: And it is true, that if any may bee ſaid to kneele before the Elements, it is the Paſtor in this part of tho action, and not the people. For when they receiue they do not ſet the bread before them, as Papiſts doe the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix, but preſently they put it in their mouthes, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt they are eating, they continue ſtill kneeling, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the bread, which is not then before them, but before the Lord Ieſus, vnto whom they only kneele. In all this the Baſtor doth imitate our Sauiour himſelfe, who firſt tooke the bread, and hauing it purpoſely before him, or holding it in his hands, <hi>Gaue thankes, and after Supper tooke the Cup, which he did bleſſe alſo.</hi> So to kneele or adore God
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:26266:129"/>before the Elements, that is, hauing them in our ſight, or obiect to our ſenſes, as ordinary ſignes, means, &amp; memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials to ſtirre vs vp to worſhip God and our Sauiour, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, immediatly, &amp; onely, and not the Elements, either in his ſtead, or coniunctly with him; is no idolatry, but the right and true forme of Gods worſhip.</p>
                  <p>The cauſe of all this errour is, you make no diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betweene the abuſe of Idols in the worſhip of God, and the right vſe of his workes, Word, and Saciaments. To pray, or giue thankes to God before an Image, with reſpect to it, is idolatry: but to pray and giue thankes to God, hauing his creatures, or Sacraments before our eyes and mindes, and being mooued by the reſpects that we conſider in them, is a moſt lawfull and religious forme of adoration. For we can neither pray to God, nor thank him, nor praiſe him, but euer there muſt bee, before the eyes of our minds at leaſt, ſomething of his works, Word, or Sacraments, if not before our externall ſenſes; and that we muſt reſpect, conſider, and be mooued thereby. Contrariwiſe, to ſet before the eyes of our minds or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, any Image, as a meane or motiue of adoration, is idolatrie. For although the worſhip were abſtracted, which is occaſioned by the Image, and were not giuen vnto it (as neuer any hath ſaid, except your ſelfe, of the externall adoration) yet it is damned, becauſe no true worſhip can be properly occaſioned by an Image, which is a Doctor of lyes, teaching nothing of God; but falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and vanities. But the bleſſed Sacrament being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by Chriſt, to call to our remembrance his death, and the benefit we haue thereby, giues vs ſo oft as we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it, a moſt powerfull and pregnant occaſion of thankeſgiuing and praiſe; which if wee ſhould neglect, and not adore, we ſhould bee guilty of the breach of the firſt Commandement, becauſe we did not adore, when Chriſt purpoſely did offer the greateſt occaſion, that can be preſented ſo to doe. Therefore, when by that occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:26266:129"/>we adore our Sauiour, both on the knees of our ſoule and body, we are no breakers, but due obſeruers, as well of the firſt, as ſecond Commandement.</p>

                  <p>It is true likewiſe, that God directed his people vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, to bend and bow themſelues towards the Arke, and the Temple wherein the Arke was, and the mountaine whereon the Temple was ſituate: partly, leſt that rude people ſhould turne their worſhippe another way; partly becauſe of his promiſe to heare them, when they ſhould pray towards the Temple, or Arke; partly becauſe of his ſingular manner of preſence in the Arko.

Likewiſe yee acknowledge that ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration may bee directed to the place of extraordinarie preſence. And hereby it is manifeſt, that to worſhip God before a creature, or before the teſtimonies of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, although we haue theſe things before vs purpoſely and not occaſionally onely, doth not import a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his worſhip with the creatures, or meanes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the which men may worſhip: for it is certaine, that if the people vnder the Law, by bending, as you ſay, and bowing of themſelues towards the Temple; Mountaine,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:26266:130"/>and Arke, had communicated any part of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the Temple, Mountaine, and Arke, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts doe with their Idols, their worſhip had beene idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and a breach of the ſecond Commandement, which God would neuer haue appointed, for whatſoeuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, eyther of his ordinary, or extraordinary preſence. Where yee ſay, That the Altars, and Offerings and other holy things, wanted the like preſence, &amp; that before theſe, they might not bow in that reſpect, it is vtterly falſe: For <hi>Salomon</hi> firſt ſtood, and after kneeled before the Altar, and prayed, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.12. <hi>And hee ſtood before the Altar of the Lord, in preſence of all the Congregation of Iſrael, and ſpread forth his hands, For</hi> SALOMON <hi>had made a braſen ſcaffold of fine cubits long, and fiue cubits broad, and three cubits high, and ſet it in the middeſt of the court, and vpon it hee ſtood, and he kneeled downe vpon his knees before all the Congregation of Iſrael, and ſpread forth his hands towards heauen, and ſaid,</hi> &amp;c. Likewiſe it is manifeſt by the Prophet <hi>Micha.</hi> 6.6. That the people bowed when they offered their Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>Wherewith ſhall I come before the Lord, and bow my ſelfe before the moſt high God?</hi> Heere we haue <hi>Salomon</hi> kneeling before the Altar, and the people kneeling, when they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered their oblations. Where you ſay, that the Arke and Cherubins were not ſeene, towards which they bowed, it makes nothing for your purpoſe, for the Temple was ſeene, and the Mountaine was ſeene, towards the which they alſo bowed: So was the Altar and the Oblations. Therefore this is but a dreame, that you haue fancied to yourſelfe, to ſay, it is idolatry to bow our knees to God before his creatures, or holy myſteries, if ſo we vſe them only as meanes, and inſtruments, and memorials, to ſtirre vs vp to worſhip God.</p>

                  <p>If yee doe maintaine this, it is an abſurde hereſie; for the holy Sacrament hath farre more euidence, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent promiſes, preſence and command, then any type vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law. Our Sauiour before his Aſcenſion, when he commanded his Apoſtles to teach and baptiſe, promiſed; that whileſt they taught his people that which hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them, <hi>He would be with them to the end of the world.</hi> Amongſt the obſeruations which hee commanded them to teach, this is one of the firſt and principall. <hi>Doe this in remembrance of mee.</hi> Is not Chriſt preſent then with Paſtor and people, according to his promiſe, in this holy action? And in another place, he ſaith, <hi>Where two or three are mette together in my name, there am I in the middeſt of them.</hi> Where ſo many Communicants are met together, is not our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour in the middeſt of them? Further, when he ſaith of the bread, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and of the Cup, <hi>This is my Blood:</hi> doth it not import a coniunction betweene his Body and the Elements, and a ſpirituall preſence of his Body in the Sacrament? And ſhould not his body and blood be as preſent to the eyes of thy minde, thy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and vnderſtanding, and to the hand of thy heart, thy faith and confidence, as are the Elements to thy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ſenſes, and bodily hand? Haue we not taught our people to this day, and yet ſhould teach them, that in this action, there is an internall and externall receiuer, the hand and the heart: that there is an earthly and ſpiritual gift, the Elements of the Sacrament, and the body and blood of Chriſt? And ſhould we not beleeue, that Chriſt, God, and Man, is as really preſent in the Sacrament, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Diuinity, as we beleeue him to bee bodily preſent in heauen, giuing and applying the ſelfe-ſame bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die which is in heauen, as really to the inward man, as the Paſtor is giuing the Elements to the outward? How dare you then affirme, that the Sacrament hath not ſuch a preſence of Chriſt, as the Arke, the Propitiatory, and the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:26266:131"/>Cherubins had. O but he ſaid, that he would dwell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Cherubins; That dwelling was typicall, but Chriſt hath promiſed to dwel ſpiritually and really in the hearts of the worthy receiuers. <hi>The bread which we breake, is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt?

Sometime hee called the Arke his face, and glory, becauſe it was a type of his face and glory; but the Sacrament is not a bare type, but a powerfull inſtrument, whereby Chriſt is communicate vnto vs, that wee may bee made partakers heere of his grace, and hereafter of his glory.

                  <p>Adoration is tyed in the new Teſtament to the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Chriſt, the true Arke, and Propitiatory; and is
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:26266:131"/>carried to that place, in which wee certainly know the ſaid Manhood to exiſt ſubſtantially, ſaith <hi>Perkins;</hi> and therefore it is, that wee lift vp our eyes to the heauens, where hee is, and direct our very externall worſhip to him.</p>

                  <p>We doe fully agree with <hi>Perkins</hi> in all this, for wee neither direct our internall, nor externall adoration to the ſacramentall Elements, nor to the place where they are, but to the Manhood of Ieſus, which wee acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and beleeue to be locally only in heauen. Therfore in the ancient Church, when the people came to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, the Deacon cried, <hi>Surſum corda,</hi> Lift vp your hearts, and the people anſwered, <hi>Habemus ad Dominum,</hi> Wee haue our hearts lifted vp to the Lord. But what is this to the purpoſe in hand? For the queſtion is not, in whom God ſhould bee worſhipped, or in what place Chriſts Manhood is, wherin God ſhould be worſhipped; but the queſtion is, whether at the Sacrament in the act of receiuing the ſacramentall Elements externally, and the body and blood of Ieſus Chriſt, internally; we may bow our knees, and lift vp our hearts, and adore that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, by reaſon of the perſonall vnion, that it hath with the Godhead, and the Godhead dwelling in the Manhood corporally. This is the only true relatiue worſhip accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, in the Humanitie to worſhip the Diuinitie, and the Humanitie with the Diuinitie in one Perſon, the inuiſible God in his owne eſſentiall and incarnate Image, the Lord Ieſus: That ſuch worſhip may, and ſhould bee performed in receiuing the bleſſed Sacrament, neuer any Diuine, ancient or moderne, hath doubted to this day, except Anabaptiſts and Arrians, who deny Chriſts Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and will neither adore him in the Sacrament, nor any other action of Diuine worſhip.</p>

The ancient cuſtome of the Church was ſuch; for in the dayes of <hi>Cornelius</hi> Biſhop of Rome, <hi>anno</hi> 251. as <hi>Euſebius</hi> records, <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 32. when <hi>Nouatus</hi> gaue the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to his people, he held their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, &amp; inſteed of the bleſſing which he ſhould haue vſed at the deliuery of the Eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:26266:134"/>kneeling.

                  <p>The meditation vpon the analogie betweene the ſigne, and the thing ſignified, cannot be the principall worke of the ſoule, it being nothing elſe, but the conſideration of the ſimilitude, that is betweene the natuall vſe of the ſignes, and the ſpirituall vſe of the thing ſignified: Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that as the Elements ſerue to nouriſh the outward man: ſo the body and the bloud of Chriſt, hath a vertue to nouriſh the inward man; and by eating and drinking, the Elements are applied to feede the body: So by faith, the body and the blood of Chriſt are applied to feed the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:26266:134"/>ſoule. Such a meditation, an Hypocrite and Reprobate may haue at the Table, therefore it cannot be the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall worke of the minde, which diſtinguiſheth the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie, from the vnworthie Receiuer. When we heare and reade the Word, the principall work of our mind, ſhould not be a meditation vpon the forme of the characters, the ſound of the letters, the coniunction of them, their ſounds in the ſyllables, the ſyllables in the words, or the force and vertue of the words to ſignifie the matters; but the chiefe work of our mind ſhould be to conceiue, vnderſtand, and conſider rightly what is ſpoken. So when we come to the Sacrament, the chieſe employment of our minde, ſhould not be to conſider the proportion that is betweene the naturall vſe of the Elements, and the ſpirituall vſe of Chriſts body and blood, but a meditation and ſpirituall action correſpondent, and analogicke to the externall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall actions. As therefore the principall externall ſacramental actions, are to take, eate and drink reuerent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſymbolick Elements, the bread and wine; ſo the principall worke of the ſoule, correſpondent by analogie thereto, is to remember the ſacrifice of Chriſt, the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his body, and ſhedding of his blood: to conſider the benefit that we haue thereby, to put our confidence therein; and for all, to praiſe and magnifie his name with thankfulneſſe. This worke and meditation, is proper to the worthy Receiuers, and ſtirreth vp in the ſoule, that moſt reuerent eſtimation and affection towards our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, with an humble ſubmiſſion of our minds vnto him, which we call adoration: whereof the outward teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie and figne, is the humble and reuerent geſture of the body, preſcribed in the act, which is alſo a geſture moſt conuenient for prayer. So this geſture preſcribed in the act, doth not only attend the prayer vttered by the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, and conceiued by the people in the act of receiuing, but is proper to that, which is indeed the chiefe and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal exerciſe &amp; work of the mind, in al worthy receiuers.</p>

                     <hi>Perkins</hi> ſpeakes rightly: for if the worſhip be ſecret and mentall, it muſt be concealed from the eyes of men: but if it be mentall, and publike, ſuch as are the prayers of the people in time of diuine Seruice, who mentally follow the prayer publikely vttered by the Paſtor, theſe mentall prayers muſt be offered with ſuch external ſignes of adoration, as are vſed in the Congregation. But in the act of receiuing, ſay yee, that cannot bee, becauſe it is a breach of the ſecond Commandement, and of the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution: I anſwere, That reaſon of yours is the caption called <hi>Petitio principy,</hi> to take that for granted which is in queſtion, and I may truely ſay, already confuted. So that there remaines now no more queſtion, but that wee may both pray and kneele in the act of receiuing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breach of the ſecond Commandement, and moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably to the Inſtitution.</p>

                  <p>I heare there is alledged a third ſort of prayer, to wit, that the very act of receiuing is of it ſelfe a reall prayer. Is not this as much, as to ſay, That crauing, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing is all one? <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, that prayer of it ſelfe, and of the owne proper office, doth impetrate; and that a ſacrifice hath the force and power of obtaining and impetrating, becauſe it is <hi>quaedam oratio realis, non verba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> a certaine reall prayer, not a verball. Wee may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue him to ſay this of the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, where there is an offering of a ſacrifice to God: but <hi>Bellarmine</hi> was neuer ſo abſurd, as to call the act of receiuing from God, a reall prayer to God.</p>

                  <p>No man, I thinke, will alledge, that the act of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing is praying, or crauing, although theſe two may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree well together. But it is true, that the celebration of this Sacrament is a reall thankſgiuing to God for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of our redemption; and although it be not a propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatorie,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:26266:136"/>or impetratorie ſacrifice, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, yet it is euchariſticke, and a commemoration of the propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory, and impetratory ſacrifice of Chriſt: And in the very act of receiuing, and by the act of receiuing, wee doe openly acknowledge and confeſſe before the world, that our confidence of ſaluation is onely in the ſacrifice of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt; which is, a reall prayſing, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying, extolling, and preaching of his death vntill his comming againe. Now to conclude, yee haue made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny long anſweres to a ſhort obiection, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the argument remaines in force. Your obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on proponed was this:
<q>
                        <hi>Wee may pray in the act of receiuing, therefore wee may kneele.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your firſt anſwere to this obiection was, That knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is not the onely proper and commendable geſture of prayer, and thereupon concluded, we might not kneele. This, as we haue ſhewed, is not a good conſequence.</p>
                  <p>Next, yee anſwered, that to pray in the act of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery is againſt the Inſtitution. This we haue confuted.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, you anſwered, that wee ought not to pray before a creature: and therefore might not pray in the act of receiuing. The antecedent of this is falſe, as wee haue ſhewed: at leaſt, as it is conceiued, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion holds not.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, yee ſayd, that we are not commanded by the act of <hi>Perth</hi> to pray; and therefore that we may not pray. This followes not.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, becauſe the prayer of the people in the act of receiuing is mentall, yee inferred, that they might not kneele: and this is no good conſequence.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, yee ſayd, wee may not kneele before the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixe, and before <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Image, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may not kneele in the act of receiuing the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And this is moſt abſurd, the Sacrament being a part of Gods worſhip, inſtituted by himſelfe: but the vſe
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:26266:137"/>of Idols and Images in his worſhip he hath expreſſely forbidden. So all your anſweres are meere ſophiſticall captions and abductions from the purpoſe: yet yee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede to anſwere ſome others, that yee frame againſt your ſelfe.</p>

                  <p>Their other obiection, that we may praiſe God in the act of receiuing, therefore wee may kneele, may bee anſwered after the ſame manner. There is no publike thankſgiuing ordained to be made at the deliuery of the Elements: mentall praiſe therefore muſt be meant. Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall praiſe is no more the principall worke of the ſoule, then mentall prayer: what was ſayd of the ejaculations of the one, let it bee applyed to the ſhort ejaculations of the other.</p>

                  <p>If yee anſwere this obiection as yee did the former, then let the reply vſed by me be here repeated. But I ſay further, that by the words of the Inſtitution, <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me,</hi> we are ordayned, not onely mentally to giue praiſe, but alſo really, and publikely by the very action and celebration of the Sacrament it ſelfe: in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect whereof the learned <hi>Pareus</hi> calleth this remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,

                  <p>The name of the Euchariſt giuen to this Sacrament helpes them nothing, for it is a name giuen by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, and not by the Scripture.</p>

                  <p>The Trinitie is a name giuen by the Ancients, and not by the Scripture, to the three Perſons ſubſiſting in the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:26266:137"/>vnitie of the diuine nature, yet the truth of that which the word ſignifies, being found in Scripture, it helpes to conuince Heretikes, that deny the ſame: ſo the name of the Euchariſt giuen to the Sacrament, to declare the thankfull commemoration of our Sauiours death, which thereby we performe according to the Scripture, helpes vs much againſt you and your followers, that ſpoile the Sacrament of the moſt principal end, for which it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, that is, to the praiſe and honor of our Sauiour; in reſpect whereof, it is called <hi>Sacrificium Euchariſticum,</hi> a Sacrifice of thankeſgiuing. This Sacrifice the Paſtor real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acts, in taking, bleſſing, breaking, and giuing of the externall Elements; for thereby the death of Chriſt, and the application thereof to the faithfull is repreſented: and it is acted by the people, in their taking, eating, and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, for thereby they declare and teſtifie the hunger, thirſt, and deſire of their ſoules after the righteouſneſſe and life of Chriſt, and the ioy they haue in the meditation thereof, with that aſſured confidence wherwith they reſt, and repoſe themſelues therupon. And this repreſentation and application of Chriſts death, with the teſtification of our faith therein, and thankfulneſſe therefore, by the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Sacrament, is a reall extolling, preaching, magnifying and praiſing of the Lords death, from which, mentall praiſe cannot be ſeparated without hypocriſie; Therefore to praiſe God in the act of receiuing, is a chiefe part of the principall work of the ſoule, and not your me, ditation vpon the analogie betweene the ſigne, and the thing ſignified, which is only a catechetick preparation, that ſhould precede the principall worke. If yee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred the Confeſſion of Falth, which ye profeſſe your ſelfe to haue ſworne and ſubſcribed. I am aſſured yee could not haue denyed this; for in the 13. Sect. thereof about the end, yee haue theſe words: <hi>The end and cauſe of Chriſts Inſtitution, and why the ſelfe-ſame ſhould bee vſed, is expreſſed in theſe words, Doe this in remembrance of mee as oft as yee eate of this bread, and drinke of this Cuppe,

In reſpect of this, the Sacrament is called the Euchariſt, and not in reſpect of the thankſgiuing, wherewith we begin the action, as yee would haue it to be in your words following.</p>

                  <p>Although the name were taken, as <hi>Cauſabone</hi> ſaith, from one part of the action, yet it is giuen to the whole action, not by reaſon of this part onely, but becauſe it declares the nature and chiefe end of the action: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit all the parts of this holy miniſtration ſeuerally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, are not actions of thankſgiuing, yet the whole action, which conſiſts of theſe parts, being performed <hi>Gratitudinis</hi>

So it is true, to take the bread is not an action of thankeſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, nor to breake it, nor to giue it, being ſeuerally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered; but to take, breake, bleſſe and giue, with inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by theſe actions to repreſent the death of Chriſt, and the application thereof to the faithfull, for the praiſe of

                  <p>The relation betweene the Giuer and the gift, in the old Teſtament is not ſo euident, becauſe they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a cleare and expreſſe Word to expound the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: Where haue yee ſuch a Word concerning Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion? <hi>This is the putting off of the bodie of ſinne, by the vertue of Chriſts Death and Reſurrection,</hi> COLOS. 2.11. or concerning the Paſſeouer, <hi>This is the body of Chriſt, that is broken for you, this is his blood, that is ſhed for you?</hi> The Law had but the ſhaddow, the Goſpell hath the expreſſe Image of good things to come: In the Law they had the ſhadow of the Giuer, and the gift, but in the Goſpell we ſee him with open face. Now although to the ſhadow of the Prince men fall not downe, nor doe reuerence, they are to be excuſed; but he muſt bee reputed a contemner, who will not doe homage at the preſence of his Prince. Further, as I ſaid before, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall actions of their Sacrament, could not bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:26266:140"/>performed with ſuch a geſture, as is knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but the action of our Sacrament may.</p>

                  <p>Next, we receiue the myſticall pledges, not out of the hands of God himſelfe, or his Sonne Chriſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, but out of the hand of the Miniſter. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who receiues the gift from the King, is ſuppoſed to receiue it immediately: and ſuppoſe mediatly, yet ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of Court, and mediate ciuill worſhips, are not rules of religious adoration, which ſhould euer be immediate.</p>

                  <p>Wee kneele not to receiue the myſticall pledges, but to receiue the bodie and blood of Ieſus Chriſt, which the myſticall pledges ſignifie, and are deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red immediately, by the hand of the Lord Ieſus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, the manner of deliuery of the gift, and the will of the Giuer, are to be conſidered. If the Prince call his Nobles to a banquet, it is his will that they ſitte at table with him, as <hi>Ionathan</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> ſate at King <hi>Sauls</hi> table. Chriſt hath declared by the Inſtitution, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what manner he would haue vs to receiue theſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall pledges. Kneeling cannot agree with the actions and precepts of the Inſtitution.</p>

                  <p>If we conſider the manner of deliuery of the gift, and the will of the Giuer, it fauoureth kneeling, rather then ſitting: for although we be inuited to a banquet,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:26266:140"/>yet it is not a bodily repaſt, ſuch as <hi>Ionathan</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> receiued at <hi>Sauls</hi> table. That required leiſure and time, and ſuch a ſite and poſition of bodie, as is moſt commodious for eaſe; but by the Inſtitution it it manifeſt, that the banquet whereunto wee are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, is the body and blood of Ieſus, giuen externally in a little quantitie of bread, and one Cuppe diuided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many, and miniſtred internally with Chriſts owne hand. Neyther come wee to this banquet to feede our bodies, but to feede our ſoules, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll and praiſe his death, as I haue ofte ſaid before. Whereupon the Apoſtle inferreth, that wee ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue worthily, that is, with ſuch a reuerence, both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall and internall, as is worthie the Giuer, and the gift, and is moſt meete to ſet foorth the praiſe of the Giuer, and the worth of the gift. In this reſpect, knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is moſt agreeable, both to the actions and precepts of the Inſtitution.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond breach of the ſecond Commandement, made by kneeling, is the ſhew of conformitie with the Papiſts. The Lord forbade his people to bee like the Gentiles, <hi>Leuit</hi> 18.3. and 19.27. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. The Chriſtians were forbidden to decore their houſes with Bay-leaues and greene bonghes, becauſe the Pagans vſed ſo to doe; or to reſt from their labours vpon the dayes that the Pagans did. If conformitie in things not hauing ſtate in idolatrous ſeruice, but onely glaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing at the honour of the Idoll bee condemned, farre more is conformitie in the groſſeſt act, wherein the life and ſoule of their idolatrie ſtandeth. Such is the geſture of kneeling amongſt the Papiſts, this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conformitie tickleth the Papiſts, and offendeth the godly.</p>

                  <p>A ſhew of conformitie with the Papiſts in Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, is a breach of the ſecond Commandement: But to kneele at the Sacrament, our hearts being freed of the opinion of Tranſubſtantiation, and our mouthes confeſſing and profeſſing, that we doe onely kneele to God, and our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt; is no more confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie with them in idolatrie, then in the action of prayer to kneele, when we direct our prayers to God, and not to Angels or Saints, or other creatures. For example, To kneele, and ſay the Lords Prayer in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Saints, and to offer it as a libell of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to be preſented, and commended by their prayers to God, which Papiſts profeſſe themſelues to doe, <hi>(Coſteri Enchiridion de veneratione Sanctorum,)</hi> is idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie; yet to kneele, and offer that prayer to God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as wee doe, is not idolatrie: although both in the geſture of kneeling, and in the ſubſtance of the prayer, there bee a conformitie, our Faith and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion being contrarie to theirs, freeth vs of all ſhew of conformity with them in ſuperſtition and idolatry. But the Lord forbade his people (yee ſay) to be like the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, yet did he neuer forbid them to knele, and lift vp their hands to him in their prayers, although the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles kneeled, and lifted vp hands vnto their gods when they prayed. The things wherein God forbade his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a conformity, were vncleanneſſe, idolatry, ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, witcheraft, &amp;c. and not ſuch ceremonies of diuine worſhip, as are by himſelfe commanded, yet abuſed by Idolaters. And where yee ſay, that Chriſtians were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to reſt thoſe dayes, on which the Pagans reſted, I hope yee will not haue vs to worke on the Lords day, becauſe the Papiſts reſt that day. Finally, when yee ſay, that the life of Popiſh idolatrie conſiſteth in kneeling,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:26266:141"/>yee ſpeake falſely; for the life of their idolatrie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in a profeſſed adoration of the bread, with opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Tranſubſtantiation, and not in the outward geſture of kneeling, which being lawfull, and religious in it ſelfe, is onely abuſed by them to idolatrie. And doe not all they who ſitte at the Sacrament, keepe an outward conformitie with the <hi>Arrians,</hi> who will needs ſitte, to declare, that they eſteeme Chriſt Ieſus to bee onely a meere man? By your argument, all they are tranſgreſſours of the firſt Commandement, that communicate with them in ſitting. Now to that which yee adde in the end, that this outward confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie tickles the Papiſt, and offends the godly: yee are greatly miſtaken; it is your contentious oppoſition againſt the truth, and diſobedience of the lawfull ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Church, which tickles the Papiſt, and grieues all good men; and not our conformitie, in a lawfull and religious ceremonie.</p>

This geſture had a ſpot of prophanation from the beginning, being at the firſt birth in this act dedicated to idolatrie.

                  <p>You make the third breach of the ſecond Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement by kneeling, the retaining of a monument of vile idolatrie; and in this yee erre, for kneeling is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ceremony appointed by God himſelfe to bee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in all actions of adoration, and was not of humane inuention; therefore cannot be a monument of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie in this or any other act. If it be abuſed to idolatry, although abuſe the thereof ſhould bee abhorred, yet the religious geſture it ſelfe, is not to be deteſted. Let the theefe bee hanged, and the whoore drowned, yet the religious ceremony muſt bee reſtored to the right owner, to whom all knees ſhould bow. The burning of Incenſe was a part of the ceremoniall worſhip vnder the Law, and abuſed to idolatrie, when it was offered to the brazen Serpent; yet that part of worſhip was not aboliſhed, but the Idoll it ſelfe deſtroyed, and the ceremony reſtored to God, vnto whom of right it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed. Neither hath your compariſon of the brazen Serpent, and kneeling, any force in it; for the brazen Serpent, in the time it was aboliſhed, had no vſe: that ceaſed with the vertue of the cure, that the Iſraelites receiued by looking vpon it; the act of kneeling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth alwayes in a neceſſary vſe, for the better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of our thankfulneſſe to God. And where you ſay, that kneeling from the firſt birth in this act, hath been dedicated to idolatrie, I flatly deny it: for albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it <hi>Honorius</hi> a foure hundreth yeares ſince, or there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, was the man that decreede kneeling to bee vſed in the eleuation, and circumgeſtation of the Hoſte; yet it was not he, that brought in that geſture at the time of participation. In the eleuation or circumgeſtation, the ſame, I grant, was abuſed to idolatry, but neither theſe, nor the Hoſte in them, were the Sacrament; for
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:26266:142"/>when the bread or cup are not vſed according to the Inſtitution, they ceaſe to be the Sacrament; ſo knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling directed to the bread at the eleuation, &amp;c. was not a prophanation of it at the Sacrament, but a propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of it in a ſuperſtitious, and idolatrous worſhip. In reſpect of this, <hi>Caluine</hi> and ſome other recent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, haue diſliked it; and yet they ſay, if kneeling in the action of the Supper, did not reſt in the Elements, but were directed to Chriſt ſitting in heauen, the ſame were a lawfull ſort of adoration. This <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> ſaid, whoſe words are <hi>Neque externa adoratio eſſet mala, multi enim piè genua flectunt, &amp; adorant,</hi> that is to ſay, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall adoration in that caſe, were not euill, for many piouſly bow their knees, and adore. <hi>Beza</hi> in his twelſth Epiſtle, ſaith, That the bowing of the knee at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of the Elements, is a ſort of holy and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an reuerence, <hi>Ac proindè olim potuit cum fructu vſurpari,</hi> that is, of old, it might haue been vſed profitably. That teſtimony which you cite out of the eight Epiſtle, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your cuſtome, yee corrupt, to make it ſerue your purpoſe: for <hi>Beza</hi> commending them that abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed kneeling at the receiuing of the Sacrament, ſaith not, <hi>tanquam apertas idolomanias,</hi> but <hi>non minus quam aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas idolomanias,</hi> and ſo diſtinguiſheth it from idolatrie: like as a little before in the ſame Epiſtle, he ſaith, That this geſture of kneeling being conſidered in it ſelfe, is not impious; and in his twelfth Epiſtle ſpeaking of the ſame matter, he hath theſe words, <hi>Interim tamen eum iſta per ſe non ſint idololatrica, idem de illis, quod de proximè praece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentibus ſentimus.</hi> So we haue <hi>Caluine, Martyr</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> all of them contradictors to you in this, that kneeling at the Sacrament is a monument of vile idolatry. Where I marke further, that in <hi>Beza</hi> his iudgement, kneeling was not at the firſt birth, in this act, dedicated to ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, for he ſaith of it, <hi>quòd olim potuit cumfructu vſurpari,</hi>
                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:26266:143"/>that of olde time, it might haue beene vſed profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and the words hee ſubioynes make this yet more manifeſt, <hi>Tamen quia ex hoc fonte orta eſt artolatria;</hi> If Bread-worſhip did ſpring from kneeling according to his minde, then kneeling at the Sacrament, was in vſe before Broad-worſhip, and ſo was not dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as yee ſay, to idolatrie in this act from the firſt birth thereof. But to the end, the weakeneſſe of your Achillean argument may appeare, let vs put it in forme:
<q>
                        <hi>Whatſoeuer ceremonie in an act of diuine worſhip, ſuch as the Sacrament is, hath been dedicated to idolatrie from the firſt time it was vſed, in that act, the ſame is to bee remoued from the act, as a monument of vile ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I anſwere, that wee muſt conſider the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie it ſelfe, whether it bee of humane or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine inſtitution; if it bee of humane inſtitution, it may be remooued, ſuch as is the croſſing of the bread and cuppe in the Sacrament: But if the ceremony bee of diuine inſtitution, ſuch as kneeling is, for the ſame is commended by God vnto vs in his Word: then wee ought to conſider, whether the abuſe of that ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie hath proceeded from the nature of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein it was vſed: for if it bee ſo, it ought to be aboliſhed in that action, becauſe it can neuer bee purged from the ſpotte which it contracteth by the action; and in ſuch a caſe, the action and geſture ought both to bee aboliſhed. But if the abuſe proceede not from the nature of the action, but from the opinion of the agent; then the opinion being remoued, the religious ceremonie may bee vſed without any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation of idolatrie: for example, The abuſe, of kneeling in eleuation, &amp;c. proceeded not onely from the opinion of the agent, but from the nature of the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:26266:143"/>action, which is idolatrous and ſuperſtitious: kneeling in this action cannot be purged from the contagion of idolatry, becauſe of the relation it hath to the idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous action: and therefore both the action and the geſture ought to bee aboliſhed. But the Sacrament of the Supper being an action inſtituted by GOD, and kneeling being of the owne nature an holy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ceremony, it can neuer receiue contagion of idolatrie from it, but onely from the opinion of the agent: then remooue the opinion, both the action it ſelfe may bee rightly vſed, and kneeling therein, as being very agreeable to the nature of the action. For wee cannot deny, that CHRIST in this action is to be adored, and of that wee giue euident teſtimony, euen when wee ſit at Table; for our ſitting bare-headed is a ſigne of adoration, as well as knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; and is no leſſe idolatrous, if it be done for ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the bread. That to conclude, if wee remoue not the euill opinion, the ſuperſtition remaines, and pollutes the action: but if the opinion be taken away, neither doth the action pollute the geſture, nor the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture the action, both of them being religious, and of diuine Inſtitution, ſorting and agreeing naturally one with another.</p>

                  <p>The fourth breach of the ſecond Commandement made by kneeling, is the continuall danger, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of idolatry. We are forbidden all occaſions, and prouocations of Idolatry. There is a naturall prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in all men to idolatry, great ignorance in the common people, and ſuperſtition rooted in the hearts of men: Papiſts daily encreaſe, the idoll of the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die god is ſtill in great account in the Romane Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches round about vs, &amp; in priuate corners amongſt vs:
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:26266:144"/>and yet men are not aſhamed to ſay, that all memory of former ſuperſtition is paſt, and no perill is to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againe.

                  <p>Your fourth breach is the occaſion and danger of idolatry. But kneeling imports no more danger, nor occaſion of idolatry, then ſitting doth of prophanation and contempt of the Sacrament: and with vs there be many moe prophane Chriſtians, then idolatrous Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts; and people are farre more ready by ſitting to take occaſion of deſpiſing the Sacrament, their ſenſes
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:26266:144"/>leading them to eſteeme baſely of it, then by kneeling, to thinke the bread and wine to be the body and blood of Chriſt materially; the ſame being againſt ſenſe and reaſon, and the doctrine of the Word, which teacheth them the contrary. The Virgins in <hi>Cyprians</hi> time, by walking and talking, and lying with yong men, did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelues to vncleanneſſe, and as <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith, gaue place to the Diuell; but the lawfull vſe of a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ceremony, can neuer be the occaſion of idolatrie, nor can the vſe of it giue place to the Diuell: <hi>Res bonae neminem ſcandalizant,</hi> ſaith TERTVLLIAN <hi>de velan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irginibus, niſi malam mentem.</hi> That is, good things giue offence to none, but an euill minde. The iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Belgick Churches, we reproue not, becauſe they know beſt, what ſerues to the edification of their Churches; nor will they (I hope) reprooue our iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning kneeling, which is grounded vpon reaſons as expedient for our eſtate, as any can be alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by them, for their owne: but the liberty which they giue to celebrate the Sacrament with the geſture of ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ſtanding, or paſſing, condemnes flatly your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, of the neceſſity of ſitting, which neuer any Church or Diuine, ancient or moderne did hold, except your ſelfe; yet pardon me for reckoning you amongſt the Diuines. As to the feare of Bread-worſhip, it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be cauſed by the religious vſe of kneeling, but by ſome peruerſe diſpoſition of the Receiuer, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can remedie ſufficiently, but right information made by ſound doctrine. It is true, that to the vncleane, all things are vncleane: a ſoule that is euill diſpoſed, may like a Spider conuert into poyſon the iuyce of the ſame flower which the Bee turneth into hony: out of the ſacramentall Word, <hi>This is my body, which is broken ſor you,</hi> the Papiſt draweth the poyſon of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation; but the true Chriſtian, the ſweet and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:26266:145"/>participation of the body of our Lord. The word giues not to the Papiſt an occaſion of his errour, but he takes occaſion at the Word, becauſe of the peruerſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of his minde; ſo kneeling being a religious ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie, and commanded by God, when it is lawfully vſed at the receiuing of the Sacrament, can neuer giue occaſion of Bread-worſhip, although ſuperſtitious men hauing corrupted their mindes, may make it an occaſion of that, and worſe. The geſture of ſitting is at this day abuſed by <hi>Arrians,</hi> and made a ſigne of their deniall of the God-head of Chriſt; and prophane Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians haue taken, and daily take occaſion thereby, to fall into the pit of contempt, and prophanation of this Sacrament, from which inconuenience, no ceremonies that can be choſen, will preſerue them, except they be warned daily, and directed by the Word how to carry themſelues; and if we neglect this, committing their ſafetie to the ceremonies of ſitting, ſtanding, walking, or kneeling, we ſhall not only bring them to the brinke of danger, but ſhall drowne them in the depth, either of prophaneneſſe, or of ſuperſtition and idolatry. Now, if you thinke that there is greater danger of idolatrie to be feared from kneeling, then of prophaneneſſe from ſitting, you are much deceiued: for if wee conſider the diſpoſition of our people, amongſt whom, ſome I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe haue vnderſtanding, &amp; yet are inclined to ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; idolatry; the greater company are ſimple ones, that neuer did, nor euer will, as it is to be ſuppoſed, take occaſion by kneeling, to thinke the bread the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Chriſt, or yet to adore it for his body. This er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour was brought in by the Clergie and Scholaſtickes, wherof the people could neuer haue dreamed, if it had not been daily inculcate into their eares, and they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded ſo to thinke, by the falſe interpretation of the words, <hi>This is my body.</hi> The right expoſition of the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:26266:145"/>ſame hath remoued that error, and muſt ſtill debarre it, not the geſture of ſitting; for thereby ſimple ones are ready, by their owne inclination, to take occaſion, as wee haue knowne in time paſt, of contemning the holy Sacrament, and ſo from ſuperſtition to runne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a profanation of the Lords Body: from eyther of theſe extremities no thing can preſerue them, but the trauels of a faithfull Paſtor, in Catechizing and Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching. As to men of vnderſtanding they are in leſſe danger, and howſoeuer they receiue ſitting, ſtanding, or kneeling, they know the Elements in the Sacrament to retaine their former ſubſtance, and that they are changed in the vſe onely. Neither haue ſuch of them, as are inclined to Papiſtrie, beene conuerted a jot by ſitting, from their former errors; but to the contrarie, confirmed in their erronious opinions, diſdayning our profeſſion for the irreuerent celebration of the holy Sacrament. If at any time, by the doctrine of truth, they ſhall be conuerted from their errors, this geſture that is required of kneeling, ſhall bee a meanes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue them in a conſtant profeſſion; and as I haue ſayd, keepe them alſo from the other extremitie of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>

                  <p>The fifth breach yee alledge to be will-worſhippe.

This yee haue not prooued, nor bring yee any argument now to prooue it: but ſimple peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will not perceiue your cunning and fineneſſe. In a word, kneeling is not, as yee affirme, a ſacramentall rite, but a religious ceremony flowing from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes of that naturall pietie, wherein man was created; approued, and committed by God himſelfe to be vſed in all ſuch parts of his worſhip, as edification, order, and decency allowes.

The ſacrifices of the olde Teſtament were but ſhaddowes of Chriſt: our Sacraments, by reaſon of the Word annexed to them, and the doctrine of the Goſpell, whereby they are cleerely expounded, are viue and perfect images of Chriſt, and of the benefites wee haue by him; therefore they are to bee celebrated with greater adoration and deuotion, both externall and internall, then the ſacrifices vnder the Law, becauſe our deuotion and adoration ſhould be proportioned to the meaſure of our knowledge and faith.</p>

                  <p>I am aſſured, if kneeling be warranted by practiſe of the ancient Church, no good Chriſtian will thinke for the friuolous reaſons adduced by you, that they committed any of theſe breaches. But you labour to proue, that the ancient Church did not practiſe it: for yee ſay, that when the <hi>Arrians</hi> denyed Chriſts true diuinitie, the Orthodoxe Church, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged his diuinitie, kneeled not in the act of receiuing, which had beene expedient, if the ſame had beene lawfull: vnto which I anſwere, That there be many things expedient to be done, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding are not done, nor ought to be done; not becauſe they are vnlawfull in themſelues, but for ſome other reſpect, as ſome cuſtome receiued, or ſome order formerly eſtabliſhed, which vpon euery appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant expedience is not to be altered: for example, It was expedient, becauſe of the ſame hereſie, to haue kneeled at all times, when publike prayers were offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Chriſt, or to the Father in his name: yet on the Lords day, which was the moſt ſolemne time of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, the ancient Church kneeled not at publike prayer; not becauſe it was vnlawfull in it ſelfe to haue knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but becauſe there was an order receiued in the Church, that on the Lords day the people ſhould ſtand and not kneele.</p>
                  <p>Next, when yee ſay, that the ancient Church did not kneele at the receiuing of the Sacrament, and will prooue it by this, that it was the cuſtome of the Church to ſtand in the time of publike prayer all the Lords dayes in the yeere, and on euery day from Eaſter to Pentecoſt, becauſe of the ioyfull me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of Chriſts reſurrection: for, ſay yee, this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being a matter of great ioy, far leſſe would they
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:26266:149"/>kneele at the celebration of it. To this, I anſwere, That if the order of the Church could haue permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted kneeling, the nature of the action, although it bee a matter of great ioy, would haue ſorted well enough with this humble geſture. In the 17. of <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 16. God promiſed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that hee would bleſſe <hi>Sarah,</hi> and giue him a ſonne by her, and make her the mother of many Nations, and Kings to come of her: the Text ſaith in the next <hi>verſe,</hi> that <hi>Abraham fell vpon his face, and laughed</hi> Here yee ſee a matter of great ioy, which made <hi>Abraham</hi> to laugh, ioyned with a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of greater humilitie then bowing of the knee is. The bowing of the body and the knee, is not as your Maſter of table geſture and ye here affirme, the geſture onely of an humble Penitentiar; but it is the geſture al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of theſe that giue thanks. So the Leper gaue thanks, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.16. And of theſe who ioyfully ſing prayſes to God, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 138. <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. And of theſe who pray as our Sauiour, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.41. who kneeled and prayed, though he was no Penitentiar. And of theſe, who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered their gifts to God, <hi>Mich.</hi> 6.6. And of theſe with whom God talked, either immediately, as he did with <hi>Abrabam, Gen.</hi> 17.3. or mediately, as by <hi>Mayſes,</hi> to the people of Iſrael, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.27. And of theſe that were aſtoniſhed at the works of God or his Word, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 18.39. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.25. To be ſhort, if <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> when he did onely receiue the promiſe of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſeede, fell on his face, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.17. how much more ought the faithfull bow their knees, when they receiue the performance of this promiſe, euen the bleſſed Seede himſelfe from the hand of God in this ſpirituall Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet? So it is not the nature of the action that will enforce the geſture of ſtanding to haue been vſed in the Sacrament rather then at prayer, but the cuſtome and order of the Church only; which if ye were able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:26266:149"/>as well for ſtanding at the Sacrament, as at pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Lords day, your argument were ſtrong: but that yee ſhall neuer doe, except ye grant according to the truth, that the Sacrament is an act of reall ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. In that caſe <hi>Tertullians</hi> teſtimony, which you cite, would aduance your cauſe mightily, who ſayes, <hi>De geniculis adorare nefas ducimus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Two or three teſtimonies of <hi>Euſebius, Chryſoſtome,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> for ſtanding on the Lords day at the Table, or Altar, when the Sacrament was receiued, will not proue a conſtant and vniuerſall practiſe of that geſture. Neyther is the example of the <hi>Abiſſines,</hi> and <hi>Muſcouites,</hi> who ſtand to this day, able to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyſe the practiſe of the vniuerſall Church, for the ſpace of foure or fiue hundred yeeres preceding their dayes, wherein they kneeled at the receiuing. Nor are you able to prooue, that the geſture of kneeling was brought into the Church by the error of Tranſſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, as ye confidently affirme in the laſt line of this Section. For <hi>Honorius,</hi> as wee ſayd before, did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree kneeling to bee vſed at the receiuing of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but at the eleuation and circumgeſtation which was a ſuperſtitious and idolatrous worſhippe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented by man. And it is euident, at the time when that Decree was made, the people were accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to kneele at the receiuing; and if it had not beene the cuſtome, there is no queſtion, but the ſame would haue beene ſtraitly enioyned by the ſame Decree. But it is playne, that before that time, as euer ſince, this geſture is continued in the Church: for as Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> vpon the 98. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> teſtifies, No man doeth worthily receiue, but hee that adores. And in the ſame places hee ſaith, <hi>Non peccatur adorando carnem Chriſti, ſed peccatur non adorando:</hi> that is, Wee ſinne not in adoring Chriſts body in the Sacrament; but
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:26266:150"/>we ſinne, if wee adore it not. And <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in one of his Homilies hath theſe words, <hi>Ergo adora, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munica:</hi> that is, Adore then, and communicate: but vnto theſe, and the reſt of the teſtimonies, yee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, That it followeth not, becauſe they adored, that therefore they kneeled, becauſe (ſay yee) their teſtimonies make mention of adoration, not of the Sacrament, but of Chriſt in the Sacrament: and wee ſay the ſame, that at the Sacrament Chriſt only is to be adored, and not the ſacramentall Elements, which are the ſignes. So in this wee agree; but becauſe that maketh nothing againſt kneeling, yee ſubioyne, that their teſtimonies are to bee vnderſtood of ſpirituall and internall adoration; and to confirme it, yee quote in the Margine <hi>D. Fulke,</hi> vpon the firſt to the <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>Sect.</hi> 18. But let the Reader peruſe the place, he ſhall finde nothing in it againſt the geſture of kneeling, or any other religious ſigne of adoration; onely hee ſaith, that adoration, mentioned by the Fathers, is to be vnderſtood of the ſpirituall adoration of Chriſt, and not of the externall adoration of the Sacrament. And if hee had meant otherwiſe, <hi>Chryſoſtomes</hi> words in the 24. Homilie, vpon the firſt to the <hi>Corinths, Cap.</hi> 10. cited by himſelfe, would haue controlled his ſaying: <hi>Hoc corpus, etiam iacens in praeſepi, reueriti ſunt Magi, &amp;c.</hi> that is to ſay, The wiſemen did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence to this body. (he meanes the body of Chriſt,) lying in the Manger; and theſe wicked and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous men, leauing their houſes and Countrey, hauing finiſhed a long iourney, and comming to the place, they adored with great feare and trembling. Let vs therefore (ſayeth hee) that are Citizens of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen imitate theſe Barbarians. Thus farre <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome.</hi> Now to imitate them, is not to come with inward reuerence onely, but to ſhew it alſo in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:26266:150"/>geſture; for of them the Scripture ſaith, <hi>That falling downe, they adored</hi> CHRIST. And it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by the words following, that <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> meanes not of the inward adoration onely, but alſo of the outward; <hi>Non ſolum hoc ipſum corpus vides, ſicut illi, &amp;c.</hi> Thou doeſt not onely ſee the ſame body as they did, but thou knoweſt both his power, and diſpenſation, and thou art ignorant of no thing done by him, as being exactly and accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imitated in all myſteries. Let vs therefore ſtirre vp our ſelues with feare, <hi>Et longe maiorem quàm illi Barbari oſtendamus reuerentiam:</hi> that is, Let vs ſhew foorth much more reuerence then theſe <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> The word, <hi>Oſtendamus,</hi> manifeſtly ſhewes that <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> exhorteth his people not to the inward adoration of Chriſt onely at the Sacrament, but to the externall alſo. The practiſe of all Churches ſince the dayes of Chriſt confirmeth the ſame: for there was neuer any Church, wherein the Sacrament was receiued without ſome externall ſigne and geſture of adoration. To ſtand before the Lord in a ſolemne act of diuine worſhippe, is a geſture of adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and as yee obſerued before out of <hi>Druſius</hi> in the 51. <hi>Page</hi> of this Pamphlet, ſtanding is taken for prayer, becauſe it was the vſuall geſture at pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. The diſcouering of the head in our Church is an externall ſigne of adoration, otherwiſe our people, who are wont to ſitte at the reading of the Word, ſinging of Pſalmes, and publike prayers, did vſe no externall ſigne at all. And as in theſe actions, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering of the head is a ſigne of adoration, ſo is it in the receiuing of the Communion; and was ſo euen when wee did ſit at the receiuing: for the reuerence of the bare head was not giuen at that time to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Miniſter, nor to the externall Elements, but to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:26266:151"/>Chriſt himſelfe, his body and bloud. Now it is certaine, that the externall reuerence giuen to Chriſt in an act of diuine worſhip, is diuine: and therefore the reuerence of adoration, as your ſelfe affirmed, <hi>pag.</hi> 48. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlant and vniuerſall practiſe, compared with the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Ancients, cuidently ſhewes the vanitie of your anſweres againſt externall adoration vſed in all ages at the receiuing of the Sacrament.

So ſitting was neuer in vſe by your owne argument. As to the geſture vſed by our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our at the Paſchall Supper, which yee affirme was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued at the inſtitution of the Sacrament, it was not ſitting at a Table vpon fourmes or chaires, but lying, and leaning vpon beds: and it is vncertain, as I ſhewed
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:26266:151"/>before, whether that geſture was continued or not; and albeit it had beene continued, there was neuer Church or Diuine, that thought it exemplary; for if they had done, they would neuer haue vſed ſtanding, or paſſing, or kneeling in ſtead of it.</p>
                  <p>If we might bee bold to coniecture, with what ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture the Apoſtles receiued the Sacrament, as yee are bold to affirme that they ſate; or what geſture Chriſt would haue vs to obſerue; it were doubtleſſe ſureſt to thinke, that the Apoſtles receiued with that ſame ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, which they vſed at the thankſgiuing and bleſſing, wherewith the Inſtitution begins: and therefore that the geſture, which the Church thinketh moſt meet to be vſed at the thankeſgiuing, is the geſture fitteſt for the people to receiue; becauſe the action it ſelfe is a reall thankeſgiuing, and ſhould haue conioyned with it, the thankeſgiuing and bleſſing, wherewith the action be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnes in the minde and affection of the receiuers: and becauſe euer ſince the firſt Inſtitution, wee finde the Church to haue vſed the ſame geſture at the receiuing, that they vſed at the thankeſgiuing and prayer. For when for the ſpace of a thouſand yeeres, they ſtood and prayed, as you your ſelfe affirme, and ſo doth your nameleſſe Maſter of table geſture; then they ſtood, and receiued the Sacrament: and after that, when on the Lords day, the Church began, in ſtead of ſtanding, to vſe kneeling at prayer, they began alſo to receiue the Sacrament kneeling, which forme of receiuing hath continued to our times.</p>
                  <p>But to returne againe to your argument, where yee ſay, that the proofes made for ſtanding doe euince, that for the ſpace of a thouſand yeeres kneeling had no place, I will let you ſee how futile your argument is. The Church ſtood on the Lords day at the Sacrament, for the ſpace of a thouſand yeeres: <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſay yee, they
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:26266:152"/>kneeled not for the ſpace of a thouſand yeeres. May you not by the very ſame reaſon conclude? The Church laboured not, nor faſted on the Lords day, for the ſpace of a thouſand yeeres: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they neither faſted nor la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured at all, for the ſpace of a thouſand yeeres. If du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all that time, the Sacrament had been onely cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated on the Lords day, your argument were proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: but ſeeing the Sacrament, as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> writes, was giuen euery day, and to giue it on the firſt, fourth, and ſixt dayes of the weeke, was held to bee an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolike conſtitution: Therefore, as on the reſt of the weeke dayes, except the Lords day, they prayed, <hi>fixis in terram genibus,</hi> with their knees cloſe to the ground; ſo with that ſame geſture they receiued the Sacrament, for the Church did euer receiue with the ſame geſture, which they vſed in prayer, as I haue proued by indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. The Apoſtles receiued with the ſame geſture, which they vſed at the thankeſgiuing. This yee cannot denie, except yee ouerthrow all the grounds that yee laid, for the example and precept of Chriſt to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued. The Church on the Lords day, hath euer vſed to ſtand at the Sacrament, when they ſtood at prayer, and if you can produce one inſtance to the contrarie, I ſhall pray you doe it; or if not, ſuffer mee to conclude againſt you; that as on the Lords day, when they ſtood and prayed, they alſo ſtood and receiued: ſo at that ſame time on the weeke dayes, when they kneeled and prayed, they kneeled and receiued: and this is proued by all theſe teſtimonies of the Ancients, wherein the people are exhorted to humble themſelues externally at the Sacrament, as by the moſt cleare teſtimony of <hi>Chryſoſtons</hi> I cited before. Hereby it is manifeſt, that the geſture of kneeling followed not the errour of Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, but was receiued and retained in the Church on the Lords day, at publike prayer and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:26266:152"/>of the Sacrament, as it had been vſed before on the weeke-dayes, at theſe religious exerciſes. Thus fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing your owne foot-ſteps, and building on your owne grounds, kneeling is proued to haue been in vſe in all ages, and with your owne hands, yee haue thruſt ſitting to the doore for the ſpace of 1560. yeares.</p>

                  <p>THe Lutheran Churches do acknowledge reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence by way of Conſubſtantiation: it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therefore, that they approue kneeling. The Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches, as they damned bodily preſence, ſo haue they reiected the geſture of kneeling in the act of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. The Church of <hi>Bohemia</hi> hath retained this geſture ſince the dayes of <hi>Iohn Huſſe.</hi> In their Confeſſion exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to King <hi>Ferdinand, anno</hi> 1535. it is thus ſaid, <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtriverò Dominicae coenae verba referentes plebem ipſam ad hanc fidem hortantur, vt corporis Chriſti praeſentiam adeſſe credant.</hi> The Miniſters are willed to ſtirre vp the people to beleeue, that the bodie of Chriſt is preſent: the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer ſort amongſt them, as they haue reiected the errour of reall preſence, ſo depart they from this geſture. In our neghbour Church, ſome of their defenders of knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, will not haue vs inquiſitiue of the maner of Chriſts preſence in the Sacrament. And the Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> commends the ſimplicity of the Ancients, which diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not, whether Chriſt was preſent, <hi>con, ſub, in,</hi> or <hi>trans,</hi> in this Supper. <hi>Sutton</hi> in his Appendix to his Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the Lords Supper, condemnes likewiſe this dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſearch of the maner of Chriſts preſence. If the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Chriſts preſence be not determined, there can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe no other, but a confuſed worſhip, of ſuch a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:26266:153"/>and determinate preſence. The Papiſts acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that there ought to be no adoration, but where there is acknowledged a bodily preſence in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Hence it is, that they proue mutually the one by the other.</p>
                  <p>It will not follow, that we may change ſitting into kneeling, becauſe the ancient Church, and ſome Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches, haue changed ſitting into ſtanding: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe kneeling maketh ſo many breaches, both in the Inſtitution, and in the ſecond Commandement, and is no wayes a table geſture. By ſtanding, we accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date our ſelues to a table, to participate of the dainties ſet thereon: ſtanding was neuer abuſed to idolatrie, as kneeling hath been; we are not bound to imitate other Churches further, then they imitate Chriſt. Our ſitting is not Scottiſh Geneuating, but a commendable imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Apoſtolicall Churches, and obedience to Chriſts Inſtitution.</p>
                  <p>They flee vp at laſt to the Church Triumphant, and alledge for kneeling,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the foure and twenty Elders fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe before the Lambe: but how conclude they this, that they that are called to the Supper of the Lamb kneele at the Supper of the Lamb? And ſeeing the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſoules ſhall not be clothed with their bodies before the Reſurrection, how can they conclude materiall ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niculation of the bleſſed Saints in heauen? All creatures in heauen, in earth, or vnder the earth, are ſaid to bow their knee at the name of Ieſus, that is, to acknowledge his Soueraigne authority, howbeit the celeſtial Angels, bleſſed ſoules, and infernall ſpirits, haue not knees to bow with. The euerlaſting felicity of the children of God, is the Supper of glory; Doe they drinke conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually of that felicity vpon their knees? Thouſands, thouſands ſtand before him; many ſhall come from the Eaſt, and from the Weſt, and ſitte at the heauenly Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:26266:153"/>with <hi>Abraham, Iſaack,</hi> and <hi>Iacob:</hi> may we not then conclude ſitting and ſtanding, as well as they do knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, if we looke to the letter of parables, viſions, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories and prophecies? but ſymbolicall theologie is not argumentatiue. Laſtly, how will they prooue eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, that the falling of the foure and twenty Elders before the Lambe, is to bee interpreted of the Church Triumphant, rather then of the Church Militant?</p>

                  <p>To proue that kneeling is not practiſed in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, yee cut off in the beginning from their number the Lutherans, becauſe they acknowledge the Reall preſence by way of Conſubſtantiation. This I grant is an error, yet is it not directly fundamentall. They abhorre, as we doe, the Bread-worſhip, and they worſhip Chriſt in the Sacrament, as we ſhould do; their errour is onely in the manner of his preſence, which er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour ſhould not debarre them from the Communion of the Reformed Churches: with them yee reckon the Church of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> becauſe in their Confeſſion exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to King <hi>Ferdinand, anno</hi> 1535. they ſay, <hi>Miniſtrive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rò coenae Dominicae,</hi> &amp;c. Let the Miniſters when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe the words of the Lords Supper, exhort the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to this faith, that they may beleeue the body of Chriſt to be preſent there. By this yee conclude, that ſome of them held the errour of Reall preſence in the Sacrament; and yet their Confeſſion mentioneth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reall, nor corporall, nor locall preſence. And it is no errour to beleeue the preſence of Chriſts body in the Sacrament after ſome manner; as to beleeue that it is there <hi>obiectiue,</hi> that is, as the reall obiect, whereupon we muſt fixe and faſten our Faith: and to beleeue that it is there <hi>virtute, &amp; efficacia,</hi> in vertue, and efficacie, to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and ſtrengthen vs in newneſſe of life heere, and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:26266:154"/>raiſe vs vp vnto eternall life hereafter: In reſpect whereof, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>That his fleſh is meate indeed, and his blood is drinke indeed; and that he who eateth his fleſh, and drinketh his blood, hath life eternall, and that he ſhall raiſe him at the laſt day.</hi> Laſtly, to beleeue that the body of Chriſt is preſent in the Diuine Perſon, wherein it ſubſiſteth, albeit locally the ſame be in heauen, is no errour: for whereſoeuer the perſon is, there both the Natures are preſent coniunctly. The Diuinitie is euer, and euery where clothed with the humanitie, wherein it dwelleth bodily, and ought to be conſidered ſo in all actions of diuine worſhip: and the Humanity is euer, and euery where conioyned with the Diuinitie, albeit the ſame be not <hi>extenſiuè,</hi> or <hi>diffuſè,</hi> as the <hi>Vbiquetars</hi> hold, through euery place with the Diuinitie: As by example, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer a man is perſonally preſent, there his head, his body, &amp; all his members are preſent, albeit the foot or the hand be not in the place where the head is, yet they are coniunctly preſent with the head, where the perſon is; and ſo as Chriſt is perſonally preſent at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo is his Diuinitie and Humanity coniunctly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the Perſon. That to conclude, it is no errour ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Confeſſion aboue expreſſed, to beleeue the ſpirituall, powerfull, and perſonall preſence of Chriſts bodie at the Sacrament, and in that reſpect to worſhip his fleſh and blood there: yea, Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, That it is ſinne, not to worſhip his fleſh there. But you muſt be excuſed to exclude all from your Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that beleeue any ſuch thing, becauſe yee haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied before, that the Sacrament hath ſuch a promiſe, and preſence of Chriſt, as the Temple or Arke had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, <hi>pag.</hi> 51. And <hi>pag.</hi> 50. yee denied, that it was a ſigne that ſhould moue vs vpon the ſight thereof, to lift vp our hearts to the ſpirituall obiect of Faith (I vſe your own words) or a meanes or occaſion to ſtirre
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:26266:154"/>vp men to adore the Principall, that is, Chriſt: And ſo yee doe acknowledge; that they are ordered of God to be ſignes only, and ſeales of his graces, without any promiſe, power, vertue, or preſence of the bodie of Chriſt; that is the opinion of the Anabaptiſts. If theſe be they, whom yee call the purer ſort amongſt the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemians,</hi> I know not; this I know, that the <hi>Polonian</hi> Church eſteemes them Arrians, who ſitte at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whom I hope yee will not repute to be the purer ſort, or reckon amongſt the Reformed. Thirdly, if yee debar from the communion of the well reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, all who are of the Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> and <hi>Suttons</hi> minde, who commend their ſimplicitie, that beleeue Chriſts preſence, and are not inquiſitiue of the maner, but profeſſe with <hi>Durandus,</hi> ſaying, <hi>modum neſcimus, prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiam credimus;</hi> then ſhall yee excommunicate from your ſocietie, all that preferre the peace of the Church, to the loue of contention and curious diſputes, that haue diſquieted the Church, rent the body therof aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and diuided the ſame in factions.</p>
                  <p>Where yee ſay, that if the maner of Chriſts preſence be not determined, there can ariſe no other but a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed worſhip of ſuch a confuſed, and indetermined pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: your allegation is but raſh and prophane. Can yee determine the maner of Chriſts preſence in heauen particularly? or the manner of God the Father his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in heauen and earth, albeit we beleeue that God is in eſſence and power euery where, and that Chriſt is bodily in the heauens? Theſe determinations are but generall, and confuſed notions; yet God forbid wee ſhould ſay as yee doe, that the preſence of the Father and the Sonne in heauen, and in earth, are confuſed, or that the worſhip is confuſed, that is giuen thereto ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods Word.</p>
                  <p>As to the Papiſts, who acknowledge (as yee ſay) that
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:26266:155"/>there ought to be no adoration, but where there is a bodily preſence acknowledged in the Sacrament, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though yee be of the ſame minde, and thereupon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne all adoration of Chriſt in the Sacrament, yet we attribute no more to that their opinion, then to the reſt of their errours; and therefore affirme with the learned and Diuine Biſhop IE VVEL, <hi>That it is without doubt our dutie to adore the body of Chriſt, in the word of God, in the Sacrament of Baptiſme, in the myſteries of the body and blood of Chriſt, and whereſoeuer any foot-ſtep or ſigne of it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, hut chiefely in the holy myſteries, in which we haue a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing expreſſe I mage of all Chriſts peregrination in the fleſh.</hi> To conclude, if yee except out of the number of the reformed Churches, all that thinke that Chriſt is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the Sacrament, and in the Sacrament to be ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; I feare yee draw the number of the reformed Churches to a very ſmall count, whom yee call the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer ſort, ſuch as Arrians, Anabaptiſts, and their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers. But if by the reformed Churches, yee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thoſe, who diſtinguiſh betweene the ſignes and the things ſignified, giuing to the ſignes the reuerence due to them, and adoring onely the thing ſignified, to wit, the body and blood of Chriſt in the Sacrament; of theſe, ſome, I confeſſe, do erre in eſteeming Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to bee really and locally preſent: and yet, ſeeing they agree with vs in the chiefe and principall grounds of Religion, wee muſt not excommunicate them from the number of the reformed. But let vs lay aſide theſe, whom yee call <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>biquetars:</hi> If yee hold the reſt for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, that are in <hi>Germanie, Polonia, Bohemia, Hungaria, Denmark, Norway,</hi> and great <hi>Britaine,</hi> with the Church of <hi>Ireland;</hi> for one that ſitteth at the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the Sacrament in all theſe Churches, they are an hundred that kneele.</p>
                  <p>I mention not the Church of <hi>France,</hi> where they
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:26266:155"/>ſtand, and ſit not; whom yee condemne by your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of breaking the Inſtitution, and tranſgreſſing the Precept, and precedent of our Sauiour; and with them, the ancient Church for the ſpace of a thouſand yeeres, that ſtood and receiued, as alſo others of the Reformed, who follow their example: for when yee maintaine ſitting as neceſſarie by inſtitution, example, and precept; yee condemne all that do otherwiſe. Yet, yee could preſſe heere to excuſe them, or rather to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate your cenſure of them, ſaying firſt, that by ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, men accommodate themſelues to a table, to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate of the dainties ſet thereon. Next, that ſtanding hath neuer beene abuſed to idolatry, as kneeling hath bin: but theſe abuſes are friuolous, and nothing worth; for in the Church of <hi>France,</hi> where they receiue ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, they doe no more accommodate themſelues to a table, then they who kneele; for neither doe they reach their hand to the table, to take any thing to themſelues therefrom, receiuing all from the hand of the Miniſter; nor doe they ſtand ſocially, as yee will haue ſitting to be vſed for ſociety and familiar entertainment; but firſt one or two commeth, and hauing receiued, they paſſe to giue place to others. Secondly, yee forget, or then are ignorant, that the Prieſt ſtandeth, whileſt hee ſaith Maſſe, and receiueth, adoring the Elements. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore kneeling was neuer more abuſed by the people, then ſtanding is by the Prieſt. So as by theſe your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, the reformed Churches of <hi>France,</hi> and others, that ſtand at the receiuing of the Sacrament, are not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the breach of the Inſtitution, &amp; ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, wherewith yee charge thoſe that kneele.</p>
                  <p>In the end hauing condemned all for Idolaters, who kneele on earth at the Sacrament, yee aſcend to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and there yee deny that we are able to conclude, that they who are called to the Supper of the Lambe,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:26266:156"/>kneele at the Supper of the Lambe: but if this be ſure, that all who are in heauen bow their knees to the Name of Ieſus, it followes neceſſarily, that all, who are called to the Supper of the Lambe, kneele at the Supper of the Lambe; becauſe all the Saints in heauen, that are called to the Supper of the Lambe, are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, and without intermiſſion at the Supper; and ſo if they bow their knees at all, they muſt kneele at that Supper: for as on earth a good conſcience is a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall feaſt; ſo in heauen, the fruition of eternall felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is the perpetuall Supper of the Lambe. Then where yee ſay, that we cannot conclude a materiall genicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Saints in heauen, becauſe they haue not bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily knees: I confeſſe that is true; yet wee conclude well a ſpirituall geniculation proportionable to the materiall: otherwiſe they could not bee ſayd to bow their knees, if in their humiliation, and adoration in heauen, there were nothing in ſubſtance anſwerable to that bodily geniculation of the Sains on earth.</p>
                  <p>Yee demand, If they drinke continually the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie of heauen on their knees? I anſwere, Although they drinke not on bodily knees, yet they drinke with ſignes of greater humilitie and reuerence to GOD, then any humane creature is able to expreſſe by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bodily geſture. The ſtanding of thouſands before God, which ſignifies ſeruice: ſitting at Table with <hi>Abraham, Iſaack,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> which ſignifies the fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of pleaſure; takes not away their humble ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and ſpirituall kneeling. They performe their ſeruice with humilitie; and with humilitie they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy their pleaſures. And howſoeuer ſymbolicall The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologie cannot prooue, that the formes of adoration vſed in heauen by the Saints, is a kinde of bodily geniculation; yet it proues, that on earth that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture properly ſhould bee vſed, and is moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:26266:156"/>vſed by the Saints in adoration, which is attributed to the bleſſed Spirits in heauen metaphorically; and therefore that on earth there is no geſture more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be vſed in adoration, then the reuerend geſture of kneeling. Laſt of all, by the falling downe of the twentie foure Elders, it is euidently prooued, that thankſgiuing and praiſe may be offered to God on our knees, or in a geſture more humble, whether they bee interpreted to bee the Church militant, or trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant.</p>
                  <p>Now to conclude: When all your reaſons and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes ſhall be conſidered by the iudicious Reader, he ſhall finde, that they all tend to the contempt of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and to leade men to a prophane eſtimation thereof: For firſt, yee maintaine, that it is to be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated with no other geſture then a common banquet for bodily repaſt. Secondly, that it is not <hi>in ſtatu ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Thirdly, that Chriſt is ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not preſent in the Sacrament at all, or that his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is not to bee eſteemed preſent after any manner. Fourthly, that at the Sacrament neither his perſon, nor his body and bloud: that is, neither the giuer, nor the gift is to be adored. Finally, that all, who at the Sacrament adore him by bowing of their knees, are Idolaters, breakers of the ſecond Commandement, and violators of the Inſtitution. Theſe are aſſertions very contrarious to the iudgement of the Primitiue Church, touching the Sacrament, which of all the parts of Gods worſhippe, they eſteemed the moſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall; as <hi>Caſaubone</hi> obſerues out of the Ancients in his 16. <hi>Exercit.

For in the explication of that firſt head,

By the contrarie doctrine wee vnderſtand whatſoeuer men by Lawes, Councels, or Conſtitutions, haue impoſed vpon the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men, without the expreſſe commandement of Gods word, ſuch as be the vowes of chaſtitie, forſwearing of Marriage; and keeping of Holy-dayes of certaine Saints, &amp;c.</hi> By which words it is manifeſt, that the obſeruation of dayes here co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned, is not that, which was in the Primitiue Church, and now is vſed in the Refo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rmed, <hi>Cauſa ordinis, &amp; politeias,</hi> as our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines ſpeake, that is, for order and Policie ſake: But ſuch as are impoſed vpon the conſciences of men, as a neceſſarie point of Diuine worſhip. This obſeruation vrged vpon the people of God, and practiſed with opinion of neceſſitie and merit, was vtterly to be aboliſhed. And to baniſh this opinion, together with the ſuperſtitious Idolatrie and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe, which was otherwiſe conioyned, of banqueting, drinking, playing, quarrelling, and ſuch like enormities; it was thought expedient, that on theſe dayes, the people ſhould be diſcharged reſt from their ordinarie labours, and that no Diuine ſeruice ſhould be done, in places where there was not a dayly Exerciſe of Religion; as well becauſe of the raritie of Paſtors, to informe people touching the lawfull ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of dayes, and the eſchewing of their Idolatrous, and ſuperſtitious abuſe, as becauſe it appeared, that extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie Exerciſes on theſe dayes, would rather foſter ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, then edifie people in true godlineſſe. Neither could there better order be taken, as matters then ſtood; but our Church did neuer preſume to condeme religious Exerciſes vpon theſe dayes, which now the Aſſembly at <hi>Perth</hi> hath appointed; for that had beene to condemne both the Primitiue Church, and all the Reformed Churches now in the World, who practiſed the contrarie.

               <p>In the Aſſembly holden Anno 1596. when the couenant was renued, ſuperſtition, and idolatrie breaking forth in keeping of feſtiuall dayes, ſetting out of Bone-fires, and ſinging of Carrols are reckoned amongſt the corruptions, which were to be amended.

               <p>Yet the commemoration of the ineſtimable benefits of our redemption vpon theſe fiue dayes, was not reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the corruptions to be amended. Neither did Pulpits
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:26266:162"/>ſound, nor were cenſures put in execution againſt preaching, prayers, and other holy exerciſes in theſe dayes: for, at that time, the Preachers gaue all obedience to the acts of the Church made concerning theſe things. But doe yee not ſee, by the regraite made at this Aſſembly, and by the acts, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and ordinances by your ſelfe rehearſed, that the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtayning from preaching, and reading at theſe times, hath not remoued from people their ſuperſtitious opinions of the times, nor yet aboliſhed the enormities, and abuſes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in them? Certainly, nothing is ſo powerfull to aboliſh prophaneneſſe, and roote ont ſuperſtition of mens hearts, as the exerciſe of diuine worſhip in preaching, praying, and thankſgiuing, chiefly then, when the ſuperſtitious conceits of merit, and neceſſitie are moſt pregnant in the heads of people, as doubtleſſe they are, when the ſet times of theſe ſolemnities returne: for then it is meeteſt to lance the opo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteme, when it is ripe. Vpon theſe and ſuch other reaſons, it pleaſed his Maieſtie to require, and our Church to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend, that commemoration of the benefits purchaſed to vs by the Natiuitie, Death, Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion of our Sauiour, ſhould be made ſolemnely on theſe dayes according to the practiſe of all other reformed Churches. And there is no queſtion, the errours of the multitude, ſhall hereby, bee farre more eaſily remoued, then by any prohibition, that can be made to the contrary; and therewithall the people better inſtructed in the principall grounds of Religion, then they could by occaſionall Doctrine: as alſo, the honour of God more highly aduanced, for wee know, that ordinary ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices are performed with leſſe regard, and more coldly, then theſe which come more rarely to bee celebrated. Of all theſe, the hope is the greater, that now (wee owe it to our King, vnder God) the Churches are planted with able and ſufficient Paſtors, meete to diſcharge theſe duties. So by the Aſſembly at Perth there is nothing concluded either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarious to any former conſtitution of the Church, or to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſound Doctrine, deliuered from Pulpits in former times.

By theſe deſcriptions wee may ſee, that the Sabbath day is not properly a feſtiuall day. The ordinary Sabbath is weekely: The feſtiuall is Anniuerſary. Wee may faſt vpon the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sabbath, but wee cannot faſt and mourne vpon a feſtiuall day, &amp;c. Vpon the ordinary Sabbath all the parts of Gods worſhip may bee performed: Vpon feſtiuall dayes proper Texts, Epiſtles, Goſpels, Homilies, and Sermons, are framed for the myſterie of that day. So that the ordinary Sabbath is morall, and for the worſhip of God in generall, the feſtiuall is myſticall. <hi>Eſſentialia festi;</hi> the eſſentiall parts of a feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall day are ceſſation from worke, hearing of the Word, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the Sacraments: commemoration of diuine my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleries may be performed vpon the ordinary Sabbath, but to make vp a feſtiuall day, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> requires a determination of day, ſignification, and repreſentation of the myſteries wrought on ſuch dayes.</p>

                  <p>The deſcription made by <hi>Piſcator,</hi> is proper onely to the feſtiuall dayes preſcribed in Gods Word. <hi>Hookers</hi> is more large, and may bee applyed to the Eccleſiaſticall Feſtiuities. The Iewiſh Sabbath, according to theſe deſcriptions, is not properly feſtiuall, yet the Lords day was eſteemed ſuch by the primitiue Church and ancient Diuines, who held it not lawfull for Chriſtians to faſt thereon. Proper Texts, Epiſtles, Goſpels, &amp;c. are not to bee framed for the myſterie of the feſtiuall day, as yee ſay, but for the benefit and diuine acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on appointed to be remembred thereon. If by the ordinary Sabbath yee vnderſtand the Iewiſh Sabbath, it was not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly morall, but myſticall, as their feſtiuall dayes were: and if by feſtiuall dayes yee vnderſtand the dayes obſerued in the Chriſtian Orthodoxe Church, we deny them to be myſtically.

                     <hi>Six dayes ſhalt thou labour, and doe all that thou hast to doe.</hi> Theſe words are either a command to doe the workes of our calling, as many both Iewiſh and Chriſtian Diuines doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret: or elſe a permiſſion, as others doe interpret: If they contayne a command, no countermand may take it away. If a permiſſion, no humane authority may ſpoyle men of the libertie, that God hath granted vnto them, as long as they haue any manner of worke to doe, for the ſuſtentation of this life. The Muſcouites therefore ſay very well, that it is for Lords to keepe Feaſts, and abſtaine from labour. The Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens and Artificers amongſt them vpon the Feſtiuall dayes, after diuine Seruice to betake themſelues to their labor and domeſtick affaires, as <hi>Gaguinus</hi> reports.</p>

                  <p>Whether the words of the command, bee preceptine, or permiſſiue, I will neither curiouſly, nor contentiouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, but it ſeemes, they are not preceptiue; for if wee were commanded to ſpend the whole ſixe dayes in ſeruile labour, then times could not bee lawfully appointed for publike Prayers in Cities at morne &amp; at euening: nor ordinary times for preaching on the weeke dayes, or for exerciſe, or for catechizing; nor times for faſting vpon vrgent occaſions without ſinne, and breach of the Precept. Next the precept
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:26266:165"/>touching labour belongs not to the firſt Table, but is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized in the Command of the ſecond Table, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> giues vs to vndeſtand in theſe words, <hi>Let him that ſtole, ſleale no more, but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that hee may haue to giue to him that needes, Epheſ.</hi> 4.28. If therefore here any precept be contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it is <hi>per accidens,</hi> by occaſion onely of the principall command, touching the ſanctification of the Sabbath. Thirdly, if the words were preceptiue, and had relation to the time, that is, if a certaine time were preſcribed during the which men ſhould labour, it would bee told <hi>quam diu,</hi> how long, or for what ſpace we ſhould labour; as the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Sabbath contaynes the ſpace during the which we ſhould reſt from our labours, and not <hi>quando</hi> only, when wee may labour. It is more probable therefore, that the words are permiſſiue, like theſe in <hi>Geneſis. Of all the Trees in the Garden thou ſhalt eate,</hi> which words did not aſlrict <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> to eate of all the Trees, onely they gaue him libertie to eat of ſuch as he ſhould chooſe; ſo the words of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand aſtricts not the people of God, as ſlaues to labour ſtill without intermiſſion, during the whole ſpace of ſixe dayes, whether they bee taken for a precept, or a permiſſion: but they leaue to their arbitrement, that haue the diſpenſation of workes and buſineſſes, priuate, Oeconomicall, Ciuill, &amp; Eccleſiaſtick, the choice of houres, dayes, and times which they ſhall thinke moſt conuenient; and thus the priuate man may make choice of times to his labour, and to his refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The Maſter of the Family may appoint times to his Seruants and Children for their labour, and times for their relaxation: the Ciuill and Eccleſiaſticke Gouernours haue power to ordayne for Ciuill and Eccleſiaſticke actions, meet and conuenient times; which power is rightly vſed, when as Superiours make choice of ſuch times, as neither hurt nor hinder the neceſſary labours of their Inferiours, Like as priuate perſons, and Inferiours muſt in the diſpenſation of the times whereof they haue power, accommodate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:26266:165"/>to the order taken by Superiours for publike actions, that by a mutuall harmonie, the weale of the whole bodie both temporall and ſpirituall may be procured. Otherwiſe if by this permiſſion the libertie were granted to euery per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which you imagine, to attend his own buſineſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect of order, or ſubiection to policie, there could be nothing but confuſion amongſt men. The generall libertie granted to men touching the vſe of times, meats, clothing, talking, ſleeping, watching, &amp;c. takes not away the power of Ciuil &amp; Eccleſiaſtick Gouernors, to ſet down Conſtitutions &amp; Canons touching the Diſpenſation of theſe things for the weale of the Countrey. Neither doe the Lawes and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances touching this Diſpenſation ſpoyle men of their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but directs them how to vſe it profitably and well. The Act therefore of Councell and Proclamation made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, commanding ceſſation and abſtinence from all han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die-worke vpon the fiue dayes, that euery one may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter attend the holy exerciſes appointed for theſe times; can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee called a ſpoliation of the libertie which God hath giuen to men for labour; ſeeing, as hath beene ſaid, that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie is not abſolute, but ſubiect vnto order. Moreouer, if we conſider the matter it ſelfe, this which yee ſay, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be a manifeſt calumnie: For, if vnder the Law, God did not ſpoyle his people of libertie, when hee appointed them to reſt two dayes at Paſche, one at Whitſonday, one at the Feaſt of Trumpets, one at the Feaſt of Expiation, and two at the Feaſt of Tabernacles; how can the Kings Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie and the Church be eſteemed to ſpoyle vs of our libertie, that command a ceſſation from labour vpon three dayes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly throughout the whole yeere? for two of the dayes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, to wit, Eaſter, and Whitſonday, are Sondayes. Laſt of all, he cannot be ſaid to bee ſpoyled properly, that makes a profitable interchange without any loſſe; but he that chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the exerciſes of the body, which are little worth, with the exerciſes of Pietie which is profitable to all things, makes a profitable change without loſſe: therefore hee who
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:26266:166"/>makes this change according to the Proclamation, is not ſpoyled of his liberty, but maketh vantage by the right vſe thereof.</p>

                  <p>Dayes are ſanctified, and made holy, as are places, two manner of wayes: ſome places were made holy, by annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them a peculiar worſhip inſtituted by God, which lawfully could not be performed in another place: ſuch were the Tabernacle, and the Temple, which were alſo holy, by reaſon of the typicke and myſticall ſignification wherewith they were clothed by diuine inſtitution. Theſe places did appertaine to the worſhip, not as mere circumſtances onely, but as eſſentiall parts and properties thereof. The worſhip which conſiſted in ſacrificing, paying of vowes, obſeruation
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:26266:168"/>of certaine feſtiuities, was not perfect and acceptable, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in that place it were performed. Other places were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their vſe onely, being dedicated to the ſeruice of God, but they had not the ſeruice ſo appropriated vnto them, as that it might not be performed in another place; and ſuch were the Iewiſh Synagogues, and the Chriſtian Churches. Euen ſo ſome dayes were made holy, not onely becauſe they were dedicated to the worſhip of God, but becauſe a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all worſhip was inſtituted by God, and appropriated vnto them. And becauſe the obſeruation of theſe times, with that worſhip was typicall, and myſticke, hauing in it the ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of things to come: ſuch were the Feaſts of the Paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, of the firſt greene fruits, of Whitſonday, of the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, of Expiation, and of Tabernacles; all theſe dayes were holy, not onely for the vſe, whereunto they were appoynted to ſerue, as circumſtances, but by reaſon alſo of their my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticke ſignifitation, and of the worſhip appropriated vnto them, which might not at another time be lawfully perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Other times were onely holy by reaſon of the vſe or diuine worſhip performed on them, and not for any my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie or ſolemne worſhip appropriated to them: ſuch as theſe, which were appointed for ſolemne humiliation in the day of calamitie. After the firſt manner our Diuines hold, That it is onely proper to God to make times, and places ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but after the ſecond manner, it is a prerogatiue and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Church, to make places and times holy, by dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them to the ſeruice of God. So the feaſt of Purim, and Dedication, were made Holy-dayes by <hi>Mordecai, Iudas Macchabeus,</hi> and by the Church. So times are appoynted by our Church for Morning and Euening Prayers in great Townes; houres for preaching, on Tueſday, Thurſday, &amp;c. Houres for weekely exerciſes of prophecying, which are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in reſpect of the vſe, whereunto they are appoynted. And ſuch are the fiue dayes, which we eſteeme not to be holy for any myſticke ſignification, which they haue either by diuine or eccleſiaſticke inſtitution, or for any worſhip which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:26266:168"/>vnto them, that may not be performed at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, but for the ſacred vſe, whereunto they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted to be employed as circumſtances onely, and not as myſteries.

And hee ſayes, that we accuſe them, for putting difference amongſt dayes after the Iewiſh manner, which is the doctrine indeed of our beſt Diuines.

And this is a kinde of Chriſtian prudence and dexteritie, for who knowes not what moment there is in the opportunity of Times and Places to aduance actions?

                  <p>I anſwere, Although the circumſtance of Time, whereon the Anniuerſary commemoration is made, differs not in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, or any myſticke ſignification from the weekly dayes of preaching, yet it differres in frequency and raritie, for the dayes of weekely preaching doe returne; and to aſtrict the Husband-man to leaue his plough ſo often, were againſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie and charitie; but the times of theſe commemorations being ſo rare, to wit, three ſeruile dayes onely in the yeare, and the exerciſe ſo profitable, Reaſon would, if the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man willingly did not leaue his plough at theſe times, that by authoritie he ſhould be forced, aſwell for his owne bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, as for eſchuing ſcandall and contempt. And Maſter <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loway</hi> had reaſon to curſe theſe, who for contempt, and with offence of their Brethren abſented themſelues from the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of Chriſts Natiuitie. Laſtly, the difference of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice on theſe dayes, from the weekely and ordinary, makes them not to differ in holineſſe or myſterie from the weekely dayes, more then the difference in ſeruice, which is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med on the fift of <hi>August,</hi> and fift of <hi>Nouember,</hi> makes theſe two dayes to bee myſticke, or more holy then other times.</p>

                  <p>To make ſolemne commemoration of Chriſts Natiuitie, vpon any other day then vpon the putatiue day of his Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie, would be thought a great abſurditie.</p>

                  <p>If yee haue not fallen into this abſurditie, yee muſt grant,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:26266:171"/>that yee neuer made in your time any ſolemne commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſts Natiuitie. And, I verily beleeue, that in this omiſſion yee haue many companions; by whoſe negligence God hath beene defrauded of the honour due to him for this benefit, and the people lacked inſtruction in a principall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith. This Article is the ground of all the reſt: for as <hi>Chryſostome</hi> ſayes, If our Sauiour had not beene borne, he had neither ſuffered, nor riſen againe from the dead; and thereupon he calls the day of this commemoration, <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polim omnium Feſtorum.</hi> Euen for this it was expedient, that a certayne time of the yeare ſhould haue beene appointed for this commemoration, which otherwiſe would haue been neglected, and, as yee ſay, thought abſurd.</p>
                  <p>But to returne to your Argument, The commemoration of Chriſts Natiuitiy, is no more aſtricted to the 25. of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> then to any other time: for although the 25. of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> by ordinance of the Church, bee dedicated to that religious ſeruice, yet the ſeruice is not aſtricted to the time, as the ſeruice of the Iewiſh feſtiuities, which lawfully might not be performed on any other dayes then the feſtiuall. The commemoration appointed by our Church to bee made on theſe fiue dayes, may lawfully be performed at other conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient times, although on theſe dayes the ſame muſt not bee omitted. For the ſeruice, ar I haue ſaid, is not appointed for the Time, but the Time is appointed for the worſhip. So it is not abſurd to remember Chriſts Natiuitie ſo oft as occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is offered with all conuenient ſolemnitie, as it may ſerue to his honour, and the edification of the Church. Thus wee haue ſeene, that according to the Doctrine of the reformed Churches, Anniuerſarie dayes are and may bee obſerued, though not for any myſterie or holineſſe that is in them, more then in other dayes, but for order and policy onely. Againſt this, all the Reaſons, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> or yee haue brought, or can inuent, ſhall neuer preuaile more, then the barking of a dogge, againſt the Moone.</p>

                  <p>Next it may be obiected, that the people of God might haue indicted dayes of faſting at their owne determination, and an interdiction of all kind of worke. <hi>Anſ.</hi> They had a generall warrant from God, <hi>Ioel.</hi> 2.15. to <hi>proclayme a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall fast,</hi> according to the occurrence of their calamities, and other affaires of the Church. The light and Law of Nature leades a man to this obſeruation of an occaſionall faſt: The like may be ſaid by analogie of thankſgiuing, that wee ought to praiſe God in the meane time, when wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the benefit. But to make of the occaſionall dayes of faſting, or feaſting, anniuerſarie, and ſet feſtiuall, and faſting dayes, is without warrant. It remaynes therefore, that it is the Lords ſoueraignty to make, or ordayne a thing to bee holy. God firſt ſanctifies by commandement, and inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, man ſanctifies thereafter by obſeruation, applying to an holy vſe the time ſanctified by God.</p>

                  <speaker>ANS.</speaker>
                  <p>The concluſion agreeth not with the premiſſes: for if it be Gods ſoueraigntie to make, or ordayne a thing to bee holy, how may the Church make a thing holy by appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an occaſionall feaſt, or faſt, as yee grant ſhee may doe? The inſtinct of nature, and that command out of <hi>Ioel,</hi> is a generall warrant onely: The particular calamitie or bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, wherefore a faſt, or feaſt ſhould be proclaymed, is not expreſſed, neither is the time particularly determined, whereupon the ſolemne feſtiuitie, or faſt, ſhould be kept, but the one is left to the eſtimation, and the other, to the determination of the Church. So by that warrant, libertie is giuen to the Church to conſider, and define the cauſes, for the which a faſt ſhould bee proclaymed, and to determine the time, when the ſame ſhould be obſerued; and to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate that time from common buſineſſe, and conſecrate the ſame to the ſpirituall exerciſe of preaching, hearing, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, faſting, &amp;c. as our Church hath vſed to doe very often. Now, if the Church hath power vpon occaſionall motiues
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:26266:172"/>to appoint occaſionall faſts, or feſtiuities, may not ſhee for conſtant, and eternall bleſſings, which doe infinitely excell all occaſionall benefits, appoint ordinary times of comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration, and thankſgiuing? Ye ſay that this hath no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, but yee ſpeake without warrant: for there is as great warrant to appoint ſuch dayes, as is for any other point of Eccleſiaſticall policie, touching the determination of times, places, formes, and order to be obſerued in the worſhip of God, according to theſe generall grounds, <hi>Let all things bee done to the glorie of God.</hi> 1. Cor. 10. <hi>to edification.</hi> 1. Cor. 14. <hi>with order, and decencie.</hi> 1. Cor. 14.16. The whole policie of our Church touching the vſe of theſe circumſtantiall things is ordered by theſe rules, and according to theſe did our Church in the firſt booke of Diſcipline which yee cite often, ordayne for the purpoſe now in hand, <hi>That in euery notable Towne a day beſide the Sonday ſhould bee appointed weekely for Sermon: that during the time of Sermon the day ſhould be kept free from all exerciſe of labour, as well by the Maſter, as by the ſeruant. That euery day, there be either Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, or prayers, with reading of the Scriptures. That Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme be orderly ministred, either on the Sonday, or after Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and the dayes of prayer. That at foure ſeuerall times of the yeere, the Sacrament of the Lords Supper be miniſtred.</hi> viz. <hi>on the firſt Sonday of March, on the first Sonday of Iune, firſt Sonday of September, and the firſt Sonday of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. That in euery towne where Schollers are, and learned men repaire, a certaine day euery weeke be appointed for the exerciſe of Miniſters in prophecie.</hi> And the ſaid booke affirmes, <hi>The dedication of times, and houres for ſuch generall and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular exerciſes of the Word, and Sacraments, and Prayer,</hi> to appertayne to the policie of the Church. If the Church hath power after this manner to appoint times for Doctrine, and diuine Seruice, and Doctrine, and diuine Seruice for times, as the doctrine of the Catechiſme on Sonday at af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoone, (reade the 9. Chapter of the ſaid booke) it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denyed, but the Church hath alſo power to appoint
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:26266:173"/>a certaine time, day, and houre, for commemoration of Chriſts Natiuitie, Paſſion, &amp;c. For what more power had our Church at that time to appoint the Sacrament to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred the firſt Sondaies of <hi>March, Iune,</hi> &amp;c. then ſhe hath now to appoint a Sermon to be made of Chriſts reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vpon Eaſter day, and a Sermon of the ſending downe of the holy Ghoſt vpon Whitſunday? and does not the light of Nature teach vs, that rare and great benefits, ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred with more then ordinary thankefulneſſe? Hereby it is cleere, that it is not the Lords ſoueraignty onely to make or ordayne a thing to be holy, but it is a prerogatiue, that God alſo hath giuen to the Chriſtian Church. But to the end, this matter may be fully cleered, it is to be obſerued, as we ſaid before, that times are made holy, and places two manner of wayes; ſo things are made holy, either by ſome inherent qualitie of holyneſſe, or by conſecration of them to holy vſes. After the firſt manner Angels and men were made holy in the creation, ſinners are made holy by regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and ſanctification of the holy Ghoſt; and of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſſe, God onely is the author. Next, things are made ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by conſecration of them to holy vſes, which vſes are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther myſticall or politicall. The conſecration of things to holy myſticall vſes, as of water in Baptiſme to be a ſigne of the bloud, and Spirit of Chriſt; the elements of Bread and Wine in the Supper to be the Sacrament of his Bodie and Bloud; the Sabbath to bee vnto the Iewes a memoriall of the Creation, a type of ſignification, and a badge of their profeſſion; the Temple, the Altars, the Sacrifices, and Prieſts, to bee ſhaddowes of things to come: all theſe, and ſuch like are made, and ordayned holy by God; but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of things to holy vſes for policie, as for maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning religion, or for order, and decency to be obſerued in the worſhip of God, is not onely Gods prerogatiue, but a priuiledge, and liberty granted by him to the Church; for example, to build, and conſecrate places to be Temples, hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to bee Hoſpitals; to giue rent, lands, money, and goods
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:26266:173"/>to the Miniſtry &amp; poore; to appoint Veſſels, Veſtures, &amp; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts for the bublike worſhip, as Tables, Table-clothes, Napkins, Baſens, Cups, and Lauers for the holy Sacraments, theſe things and the like are made holy by the dedication and conſecration of men. After this laſt manner, the Church hath power to conſecrate the fiue Anniuerſary dayes to the commemoration of our Sauiour his benefits, to ſeparate them from all other ordinary workes, and ſo to make them ſacred and holy dayes. It was I grant a part of Idolatry to proclaime a holy day vnto the golden Calfe, or to any Idol, or Creature, as ye affirme; but it will not follow that it is I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry to proclaime a holy day, for the honour and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the true God. And as it was one of <hi>Ieroboams</hi> ſins, to deſpiſe the Feſtiuities appointed by God for his worſhip, and inſtead of theſe to ordaine a Feaſt after the deuiſe of his owne heert, ſo if we ſhould deſpiſe the Lords Sabbath, and inſtead thereof appoint ſome other, as the <hi>Machomet</hi> hath done, it were a preſumptuous ſinne. But this wee are farre from, acknowledging the Lords Day to bee holy by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and appointing the reſt to bee kept only for his worſhip.</p>

                  <p>I anſwered before, that if holy dayes bee taken for times, whereunto God did appropriate the exerciſe of ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular forme of worſhip, or for times clothed with ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiue and reſpectiue holineſſe, as to bee ſignes, or types of things to come, God only may make dayes holy: but if by holy dayes wee vnderſtand times dedicated to Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:26266:174"/>and the commemoration of his benefits as mee to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances for Diſcipline, Order, and Policie, ſuch as our Diuines hold, the holy dayes vnder the Goſpell to bee, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie that either they might not, or did not lawfully appoint ſuch dayes vnder the Law, or yet may not be appointed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpell.</p>
                  <p>The anſweres which you make to the dayes of <hi>Purim,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by Queene <hi>Estther</hi> and <hi>Mordecai,</hi> and the Feaſt of Dedication, inſtituted by <hi>Iudas Macchabaeus,</hi> are not ſolid. Firſt, where ye ſay, that the obſeruation was ciuill, becauſe <hi>Hospinian</hi> ſayes, they might haue wrought vpon the dayes of <hi>Purim,</hi> his opinion in that is not probable; ſeeing theſe dayes were inſtituted to bee dayes of feaſting and ioy, and ſending of portions one to another, and gifts to the poore, becauſe on them God had giuen reſt to his people from their enemies. It is not probable, when rich and poore did feaſt in remembrance of the reſt, that God had giuen them from their enemies, that they did not reſt, and obſerue the dayes according to the Inſtitution: for the Text ſayes expreſly, <hi>Est.</hi> 9.17. That they reſted and kept a day of feaſting and gladneſſe, with the which ſeruile labour ſorts not. Neither will it follow, that theſe dayes were not kept for holy Feſtiuities, albeit in them, they might haue wrought ſome kind of labour: for on the ſixe dayes of the Paſſeouer, and on the ſixe dayes of the Feaſt of Tabernacles, ſeruile worke was not vtterly prohibited, but on the firſt and eight only; yet all theſe dayes are called Feſtiuall and holy. Finally, dayes inſtituted for Documents, and Memorials of holy things, as of their Faſting and Prayers, by which they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned deliuerance, ſuch as yee affirme theſe to haue beene, cannot bee called nor counted Ciuill. And <hi>Willet</hi> compares them not euill with the fiſt dayes of <hi>Auguſt</hi> and <hi>Nouember;</hi> but hee does not ſay this as counting them Ciuill, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not <hi>diuina, ſed Eccleſiasticae inſtitutionis, non mysterij, ſed politias:</hi> and if ye thinke the fift of <hi>Auguſt</hi> and <hi>Nouember</hi> to be ciuill dayes in ſo farre as vpon them Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:26266:174"/>is made of his Maieſties Deliuerances, with Preaching, Thankeſgiuing, and Prayer; you are in a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt errour: for a day which is dedicated to diuine Seruice, and the honour of God, not to a ciuill vſe, cannot be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ciuill, but ſacred, and holy.</p>
                  <p>Againe, where yee ſay, that theſe dayes had more then humane warrant, becauſe it is thought that <hi>Mordecai</hi> was the Penman of the Booke of <hi>Eſther,</hi> and conſequently, a Prophet; and that it appeares that theſe dayes might not haue beene altered by the Iewiſh Church, which if they had bin of Eccleſiaſticke Conſtitution, might haue bin done: thoughts, and appearances, are not ſure probations to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a certaintie as yee doe, of a more then humane war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. And if they had receiued from God, any particular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection concerning them, the Prophet of God would not haue omitted the ſame in the Hiſtorie. A generall warrant they had, ſuch as the Church muſt haue for the determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of circumſtances in the worſhip of God, as that of the hundred and fifth Pſalme, <hi>Giue thankes to the Lord, call on his Name, make knowne his deeds amongst the people. Sing vnto him, ſing Pſalmes vnto him, talke of all his wondrous workes that he hath done.</hi> But to ſay, that they had any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular warrant, is to be wiſe aboue that which is written.</p>
                  <p>As to the Feaſt of Dedication, yee anſwere firſt, that if it were Anniuerſary in <hi>Salomon</hi> and <hi>Zorobabels</hi> time, <hi>Iudas Macchabaus</hi> followed the example of theſe who had Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall direction: and if it was not Anniuerſary, as firſt yee leaue it vncertaine, yee thinke the ſame was an addition of the Phariſies, who inlarged the glory of this Feaſt, as they did their Phylacteries; but this is a friuolous conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and the interpretation of <hi>Iunius</hi> words out of the Talmude is no better, to wit, that the Wiſemen who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that the eighth dayes of that Feaſt ſhould bee yeerely dayes of ioy, were the Phariſies, becauſe they are called <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientes Iſraelis;</hi> for it behoued theſe that appointed the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiuities not onely to bee Wiſemen, but men of Authoritie
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:26266:175"/>alſo: And therefore it is more probable, that the Wiſemen in the Talmude were the Maſters of the great Synagogue, that had power to appoint ſuch Feſtiuities. But how would our Sauiour, who cenſured the Phariſies for inlarging their Phylacteries, and corrected the abuſes of the Law, brought in by them, haue omitted ſuch a groſſe Errour and Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the Inſtitution and keeping of theſe holy dayes vnrebuked, if it had beene a Phariſaicall Addition, and not a lawfull Conſtitution? Then yee teach your Reader a great cunning to play faſt and looſe, in anſwering all the inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces brought from the Iewiſh Church: and that is, whether hee grant, or denie them to bee lawfull, yet to eſchew the dint of the Argument; for if hee grant them to bee lawfull, then he may flye to this refuge, that the Iewes had extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie directions which wee want; as Prophets who were only Prophets by the Spirit vnto the dayes of <hi>Malachie; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> vnder the firſt Temple, and in place thereof vnder the ſecond, a ſlender voyce ſounding from Heauen, called <hi>Bathcoll.</hi> But if hee denie the ſame to haue beene lawfull, then to alleadge that they were Phariſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Additions, and that wee ſhould not imitate the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſies and fond Iewes. I aſſure my ſelfe, that no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt-hearted man will either follow the Phariſies in their Superſtition, nor you in vſing ſuch ſophiſticall euaſions, of which, none will ſerue againſt the inſtances alledged: for if yee ſay, that the obſeruation of the dayes of <hi>Purim,</hi> or Dedication, were Phariſaicall Additions, the exact dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of our Sauiour in rebuking and correcting all ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes and ſuperſtitious Nouations, as were brought into the worſhip of God by the Phariſies, will controll you: And if ye ſay, that they had extraordinarie directions, yee ſpeake without warrant of Scripture, which is preſumption in you to doe. So it remaines for any thing ye haue ſaid, that holy dayes were, and might bee lawfully kept, vnder the Law without any particular warrant from God. But put the caſe, that the ſame might not haue beene done vnder the Law, it
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:26266:175"/>followes not, that the Chriſtian Church hath not libertie to appoint dayes, and times for religious exerciſes without particular direction. For vnder the Law, God not only ſet downe the ſubſtance of his worſhip, but all the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces alſo, as the perſons in particular by whom, the place where, and the times when he ſhould be worſhipped, ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as little, or nothing was left to the abitrement of the Iewiſh Church; and as yee ſay, theſe times were ſo ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, that the greateſt part of the externall worſhip conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in Ceremonies: vnder the Goſpell it is not ſo, for in the Goſpell, the ſubſtance of theſe Ceremonies, and of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God is perfectly ſet downe; but the circumſtantiall Ceremonies of time, place, perſons, and formes, which are no part of the worſhip, but pertinences only, are left to bee determined by the Church according to the generall Rules of Order and Decencie. It is true, becauſe the Iewes had one place only appointed by God, for his worſhip, to wit, the Temple and Tabernacle, whereunto the people could not reſort at all times, therefore to their owne election, was permitted the appointing of other commodious places for their Synagogues. And now vnder the Goſpell, there is one onely Day of diuine Inſtitution, to wit, the Lords Day, whereunto to tye the worſhip of God, is a Iudaicall Peda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogie againſt the Chriſtian libertie and practice. For the time is now come, that from one new Moone to another, and from one Sabbath to another, all fleſh ſhall come and worſhip before God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.23. According to the which Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/> pheſie, the Apoſtolike and Primitiue Church did not only conuene on the Lords Day to worſhip God, but on ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times, as they thought commodious to obſerue. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> taught often on the Iewiſh Sabbath, and at Epheſus daily for the ſpace of two yeares, in the Schoole of one <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannus.</hi> Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> teſtifies, that in ſome Churches they conuened daily, not onely to preaching, praying, and Lectures, but to the celebration of the Sacrament alſo. <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> in his Epitomie, or Abridgement of Chriſtian Faith, affirmeth, <hi>Apoſtolos inſtituiſſe ſynaxes,</hi>

                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:26266:176"/>that is, The Apoſtles to haue inſtituted their holy meetings for diuine Seruice on Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday, Friday, and the Lords Day. <hi>Socrates</hi> witneſſes, that on theſe dayes through the whole World, for the greateſt part, the holy myſteries were celebrated. Hereby it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, albeit the Church was tyed to worſhip God ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and publikely on the Lords Day, that yet they were not tyed to that Day only, but that all dayes were ſanctified by Chriſt, that the Church might chooſe, and determine of them for the Seruice of God as ſhe pleaſed. So to conclude, the Church vnder the Goſpell, hath power without any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular warrant of God, keeping the general Rules of Pietie, Charitie, and Decencie, to dedicate times and places, and ſet downe formes and orders for the worſhip of God. The Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in the Iewes Church, were not only Circumſtantiall, but Myſticall for the greateſt part, and a part of diuine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip it ſelfe: ſuch as the Church vnder the Law, and vnder the Goſpell, hath no power to inſtitute; but the Geremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies vnder the Goſpell are meerely Circumſtantiall, for the greater part, not Myſticall, and a part of the worſhip it ſelfe, but onely acceſſorie thereto: theſe the Chriſtian Church hath power to appoint. And ſuch are the fiue dayes of old obſerued by the Primitiue Church, and now reſtored againe in our Church: and ſuch were the dayes of <hi>Purim,</hi> and the Feaſt of Dedication, which were not obſerued as a part of religion inſtituted by God, but only for commemoration of Gods benefits beſtowed vpon his people in theſe times.</p>

                  <p>The obſeruation of Anniuerſary dayes pertayned to the Ceremoniall Law:
<note place="margin">The fourth Reaſon.</note> but ſo it is, that the Ceremoniall Law is aboliſhed. Yet confirme the Antecedent, by the reaſons fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Anniuerſary Dayes were diſtinguiſhed from the Morall Sabbath: many were the preheminences of the ordinary Sabbath aboue the Anniuerſary dayes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Apoſtle cals them <hi>weake, &amp; beggerly rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Gal.</hi> 4.9.10. <hi>The elements of the world, Col.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:26266:176"/>of things to come, Col.</hi> 2.16, 17. The Apoſtle ſayes not the obſeruation of Iudaicall dayes, but, <hi>ſimpliciter,</hi> the obſeruation of dayes ſerued to the people of God for a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall vſe and rudiment of Religion. If the obſeruation of ſome anniuerſarie dayes was preſcribed to the Iewes, as ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and rudiments for their inſtruction: it followes, that the obſeruation of anniuerſarie dayes is of it ſelfe a rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie inſtruction: Otherwiſe, the Apoſtles reaſon will not hold.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Dayes and Meates are paralelled: therefore, as it is Iudaicall to eſteeme ſome meates cleane, and ſome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, ſo to eſteeme one day holier then another, is Iudaicall.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, To ſubſtitute other dayes in place of the Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, as a Chriſtian Paſche, and Whitſonday for the Iewiſh, is to ſubſtitute rudiments to the Iewiſh, and not to chaſe them away.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, The Iewiſh anniuerſarie dayes were not onely abrogated as ſhaddowes of things to come, but as memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of by gone benefits.

                  <p>Theſe arguments yee vſe, to prooue the obſeruation of anniuerſarie dayes to be ceremoniall. I anſwer them one by one. Firſt, where yee ſay, that anniuerſarie dayes in the Law were diſtinguiſhed from the morall Sabbath, if ye will of this conclude, that the anniuerſarie dayes were not morall, but typicall, I will not deny it. But if yee conclude, anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie daies to be therefore ſimply ceremoniall, I ſay it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes not, and that your argument is a caption <hi>à dicto ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum quid, ad dictum ſimpliciter.</hi> The obſeruation of a weeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly day, amongſt the Iewes, was not onely morall, but a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picalliſhadow of things to come: Is the Lords Day then, becauſe it is weekely, not onely morall, but alſo typicall? But, perhaps, ye reaſon thus: Anniuerſarie dayes are eyther ceremoniall, or morall; but ſo it is, they are not morall, <hi>ergo.</hi>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:26266:177"/>To this I ſay, that your diuiſion is not full nor perfect: for, there be anniuerſarie dayes, that are naturall, as the Aequino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall, and Solſtitiall: Others, that are ciuill, as dayes of Markets, and Weapon-ſhewings, &amp;c. And there be dayes Eccleſiaſticall, which are neyther morall, nor myſticall, but meerely circumſtantiall to the worſhip whereunto they are appoynted.</p>
                  <p>To the ſecond I anſwer, that anniuerſarie dayes are not called by the Apoſtle, Elements, and Rudiments, otherwiſe then the New. Moones, which are monethly dayes, and Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths which were weekely dayes: And therefore, if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle had called dayes, Shadowes, by reaſon of their yeere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reuolution, he could not haue concluded, that Sabbaths and New-moones were Shaddowes. It is neither the week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor monethly, nor anniuerſarie reuolution, that made theſe dayes ceremoniall; for then ciuill, and naturall, and all kinde of dayes ſhould be ceremoniall; but it was the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall ſignification which they had, and the ceremoniall worſhip appropriated vnto them. That the Apoſtle forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the obſeruation of theſe dayes, and not <hi>ſimpliciter</hi> of dayes, is manifeſt, both by that which goeth before, verſ. 9. and that which followeth, verſ. 21. The dayes whereof hee ſpeakes, were Elements of the Law, from the which, that we might be deliuered, Chriſt was made vnder the Lawe: And the obſeruation of theſe dayes, was a remayning ſtill vnder the ſeruile yoake of the Law. But, there was neuer man before you, that did thinke the obſeruation prohibited for any naturall reſpect, ſuch as the yeerely, weekely, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethly reuolution is; but onely for ſome legall conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or ſome heatheniſh ſuperſtition. And ſeeing for theſe reſpects onely, the religious obſeruation of dayes is diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, it is a caption <hi>ab accidenti</hi> to conclude, that the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of anniuerſarie dayes is forbidden.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer to the third, that to eſteeme one day holier, then another, for any inherent holineſſe they haue by nature, is ſuperſtitious; and to eſteeme one day holier then another,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:26266:177"/>for any ſacramentall holineſſe, that they haue by diuine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, is Iudaicall: but, for the vſe whereunto the day is applied, as a meere and commodious circumſtance, ſo to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme it is no more ſuperſtitious and Iudaicall, then to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme a Temple holier then a priuate houſe, and the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, veſſels, and clothes that are vſed in the miniſtration of Sacraments, more holy then other common inſtruments and veſſels. Theſe we call holy, onely by reaſon of their ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from a common vſe, to a religious. So this argument is a caption <hi>ab homonymia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer to the fourth, That one thing is properly ſaid to be ſubſtitute to another, when it is applied to the ſame vſe. Our Paſche, and Pentecoſt, are neyther applied to be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials of the deliuerance out of Aegypt, nor teſtimonies of our thankfulneſſe for the Firſt-fruits of the earth, nor to be ſhaddowes of our ſpirituall deliuerie to come, and of the Firſt-fruits of the Holy Ghoſt: neyther doe wee offer the Paſſeouer, nor the Firſt-fruits, nor any legall ſacrifice; and ſo in no reſpect are they ſubſtitute to theſe times: but they are dedicated to the commemoration of Chriſts reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the comming downe of the Holy Ghoſt, not as my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall, and ſacramentall ceremonies, and a part of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine worſhippe, which the Papiſts eſteeme them to be, but as they are fit and meete circumſtancess onely for theſe holy exerciſes.</p>
                  <p>To the fift and laſt argument I anſwer, That the anniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie dayes of the Iewes are aboliſhed in euerie reſpect, for which by them they were obſerued, and ſo are the weekely and monethly daies: but, as the weekly and monthly courſe was not the reſpect for which the Sabbath and New-moons are aboliſhed, no more is the anniuerſarie reuolution of the feaſts, the reſpect wherefore they were abrogate, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were ſhaddowes of things to come, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances of temporall benefits, as of their deliuerie out of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, which was alſo typicall. And becauſe they had a legall worſhip appropriated vnto them, which was likewiſe cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:26266:178"/>Now to conclude vpon this, that the obſeruation of anniuerſarie dayes vnder the Goſpell, is aboliſhed, is a caption, <hi>à non cauſa, pra cauſa:</hi> For the anniuerſarie daies kept vnder the Goſpell, are not obſerued as any part of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine worſhip, or as ſhaddowes of things to come, or as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall ſignes and Sacraments of by-paſt, temporall, and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall benefits: but they are obſerued as commodious cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances for the worſhip appointed to be done on them, to wit, the commemoration of the ineſtimable benefits of our redemption, which are not temporall, and peculiar to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny People, or Nation, ſuch as the deliuerance of the Iewes out of Aegypt, and their dwelling in Tents, remembred by their Paſche, and their Feaſt of Tabernacles; but eternall, and common to all Nations, and People. Neither is the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip performed on them legall, and ceremoniall, but euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall and ſpirituall. Thus the obſeruation is wholly different. The time is appointed to be obſerued, not as a ſhadow, but as a circumſtance onely: the worſhip is not the ſacrificing of beaſts, or oblation of Firſt-fruits, but the Preaching of Chriſt, who is <hi>the body, the veritie, the yea, and amen, and end of the Lawe;</hi> and the Oblation of prayers, thankeſgiuing, and praiſes in his name to the Father: and the benefits which are remembred are not temporall, and typicall, but eternall, and ſpirituall.</p>

                  <p>The prerogatiue belonging to God in the Old Teſtament,
<note place="margin">The fift Reaſon.</note> was transferred to Chriſt, God and Man, the Law-giuer in the New-Teſtament, one that was faithfull in all the houſe of God. But ſo it is, that Chriſt neither by his owne comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, nor by direction of his Spirit, inſpiring the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, inſtituted any other day, but the Lords Day, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>The Theologie of your Preface or Propoſition I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not. I learne in the Scripture that the Prerogatiue of the Father is communicated with the Son, and that all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in heauen and in earth is giuen to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:26266:178"/>But I neuer read that God hath made any tranſlation, and denuded himſelfe of any prerogatiue in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that belonged to him before in the olde. That which ye ſubioyne, that Chriſt and his Spirit hath inſtituted no other day, but the Lords Day, we freely graunt: for if it were eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the fiue dayes had beene inſtituted by Chriſt, then we behoued to obſerue and eſteeme them as neceſſary parts of Gods worſhip, and not circumſtances determined by the Church, to the worſhip of God, for order and policie, which we hold with our beſt Diuines. And therefore wee ſay in the verie firſt wordes of our Act, <hi>Wee abhorre the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious obſeruation of Festiuall dayes.</hi> This ſuperſtitious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation is nothing elſe but an obſeruation of them with opinion of neceſſitie, that is, as neceſſarie parts of Gods worſhippe inſtituted by Chriſt. So in this wee agree, yet I doe not allow of the reaſons which yee vſe, for probation hereof.</p>
                  <p>Your firſt argument is, If there had beene any other dayes dedicated to Chriſt, the Apoſtle ſpake vnproperly, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely, when he ſaid, Hee was rauiſhed in the Spirit vpon the Lords Day. For if there had beene a day for his Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie, and another for his Paſſion, he ſhould haue ſaid, that he was rauiſhed in the Spirit vpon one of the Lords Dayes. This argument is friuolous. Although all the Feſtiuall dayes vnder the Law were dedicated to God, and were called Sabbaths, yea ſometimes <hi>Sabbath Sabbathôn,</hi> yet none of them is called the Sabbath of IEHOVAH, or the Lords Sabbath; that is reſerued to the ſeuenth day of the Weeke, and the ſeuenth Yeere, which reſembled Gods reſt: And although all the Synagogues were Houſes dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to God, yet the Temple is not called one of Gods Houſes, but the Houſe of God; euen ſo, the Day of Chriſts reſurrection
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, for the excellencie thereof, is called the Lords Day, albeit other times had beene appoynted for his honour.</p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:26266:179"/>
                  <p>Your next Argument is falſe: in it, yee affirme, That the Apoſtle condemnes not onely the obſeruation of Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh dayes, and the Iewiſh obſeruation of the Iewiſh dayes to a typicall vſe: for the conuerted Iewes (yee ſay) did not obſerue them as ſhadowes of things to come, for then they had denyed Chriſt: but he condemnes the obſeruation of dayes as a Pedagogicall and rudimentarie inſtruction, not beſeeming the Chriſtian Church. But howbeit the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Iewes did not obſerue the Iewiſh dayes, as ſhadowes of things to come, yet they might haue obſerued them as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morialls of by-paſt temporall, and typicall benefits, and for preſent temporall bleſſings, as the benefit of their deliuery out of Egypt, and for the Fruits of the earth, which vſe was alſo typicall: Further, they did obſerue them with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of neceſſitie, as things inſtituted by God for his worſhip, and their ſaluation, which ſort of obſeruation was Legall: but this proceeding from infirmitie, and for want of ſufficient inſtruction, was not a denying of Chriſt, as it had beene, if the ſame had proceeded from pertinacy, after the knowledge of the Truth receiued. And this was it which the falſe Apoſtles vrged vpon the Galatians, and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> condemnes in that Epiſtle written to them, and not ſimply the obſeruation of any day; for, as after ſhall bee made manifeſt, euery obſeruation of the Iewiſh dayes is not damned by the Apoſtle, who did ſometime obſerue them in his owne perſon, after a moſt lawfull manner. Neither can the obſeruation of all dayes bee a Iewiſh cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome and rite, and Pedagogicall or rudimentarie inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but the obſeruation onely of theſe dayes, which are preſcribed in the Law: otherwiſe the Feſtiuities ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> and the feſtiuall dayes kept by the Heathen, ſhould all bee Iewiſh Cuſtomes and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagogicall inſtructions, which yee will not ſay, I hope.</p>

But the ſame Apoſtle reproues the Galatians, who had attavned to this libertie, and had once left off the obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of dayes.

                  <p>After yee haue vſed two Arguments, to proue, That there is no day of diuine inſtitution, but the Lords Day, a point not controuerted amongſt vs, yee labour to anſwere fiue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections, which yee propone againſt your ſelfe; and the ſumme of your anſwere to the firſt is this: That the dayes wherewith the Apoſtle comported, were not the anniuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie dayes appointed by men, but the Iudaicall dayes, which had once that honour to bee appointed of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were to be tollerated in the weake Iewes, as long as the Ceremoniall Law, wherein they were commanded, was not buried<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the obſeruation whereof, notwithſtanding, hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and reproued in the Galatians.</p>
                  <p>Out of this anſwere, I forme this Propoſition:
<q>All the dayes, whereof the Apoſtle condemned the obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were Iudaicall dayes, preſcribed in the Ceremoniall Law, tolerated by him in weake Chriſtians, and that once had the honour to be appointed by God himſelfe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Propoſition is yours, and is very true. I aſſume,
<q>
                        <hi>But the fiue anniuerſarie dayes, appointed by the Aſſembly of Perth, are not Iudaicall, preſcribed in the Ceremoniall Law, tolerated by</hi> Saint Paul <hi>in weake Chriſtians, and ſuch as had once the honour to be appointed by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</hi>

                  <p>The Aſſumption is likewiſe yours, ſet downe in the laſt wordes of your Anſwere, and is true alſo. Therefore, I conclude,
<q>
                        <hi>That the fiue anniuerſarie dayes, are not the dayes, whereof the Apoſtle condemnes the obſeruation: Conſequently, hee condemnes not the obſeruation of dayes ſimply, as a Iudaicall Rite and Pedagogicall inſtruction, contrary to your former Aſſertion.</hi>

                  <p>It is ſecondly obiected, that ſeeing the Lords Day was inſtituted in remembrance of Chriſts reſurrection, the other notable acts of Chriſt ought likewiſe to be remembred with their ſeuerall feſtiuities. <hi>Anſ.</hi> It followes not; that becauſe Chriſt did inſtitute the remembrance of one benefit, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men may inſtitute for other benefits. Secondly, Chriſts reſurrection was a benefit including the reſt of his benefits. Thirdly, The Lords Day was not appointed to celebrate the memory of Chriſts reſurrection onely: for then, the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection ſhould bee the proper ſubiect of Diuine ſeruice euery Lords Day, and then it were vnlawfull to faſt thereupon. Fourthly, It is called the Lords Day, either becauſe the Lord did inſtitute it, as the Communion is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Lords Supper: or elſe becauſe it was inſtituted to the Lords honour, and worſhip, as the Iewiſh Sabbath is called the Sabbath of the Lord our God. Fiftly, Although it may be applyed to the remembrance of Chriſts reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſeeing he roſe that day, and in ſome ſort to be a ſigne of the heauenly reſt, yet that is, but <hi>typus communis, &amp; factus,</hi> a common type fitted to reſemble ſuch things, not <hi>typus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinatus,</hi> that is, appointed by God for that end. Finally, it was appointed for remembrance of all Chriſts actions, and for his worſhip in generall; not in a myſticall manner, for the ioyfull remembrance of his reſurrection onely. So to diuide Chriſts actions, and appoint anniuerſary &amp; myſticall dayes for their remembrance, is ſuperſtitious will-worſhip, and a Iudaicall addition to Chriſts inſtitution, in your mind.</p>

                  <p>Here onely I haue taken vp the ſumme of your anſwere which is this: That Chriſt did not inſtitute the Lords Day for a remembrance of his reſurrection in a myſticall manner, and therefore wee haue no warrant to appoint myſticall dayes for remembrance of the Natiuitie, Paſſion, and the reſt of his notable actions. Vnto which I anſwere, firſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, That it is the iudgement of ſome recent Diuines,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:26266:181"/>that the Lords Day was onely inſtituted as Eccleſiaſticall dayes are, for order, and policie, and hath no further but a circumſtantiall vſe in the worſhip of God.

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:26266:182"/>Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt alſo roſe againe from the dead the ſame day. In the iudgement of theſe Ancients, the Lords Day was not onely inſtituted for the worſhip of God in generall, and in that reſpect called the Lords Day, but becauſe Chriſt roſe vpon that day, and by his reſurrection ſtamped it to bee a memoriall as well of his reſurrection, as of the eternall reſt whereunto we ſhall be raiſed on the laſt day. In a word, it was not onely inſtituted for order, and policie, but alſo for a myſterie; and therein differs from Eccleſiaſticall dayes, which are onely appointed for a circumſtantiall and not for a myſticall vſe.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things being premitted, I come to anſwere the particulars. Firſt, where yee ſay, that albeit Chriſt did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a day in remembrance of one benefit, men may not for other benefits: I grant that men may not inſtitute a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall day to be obſerued as a part of Gods worſhip, yet they may appoint a commodious day to a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> of his benefits.</p>
                  <p>Next, where yee ſay, the reſurrection includes the reſt of Chriſts benefits; it is true in ſome ſenſe, that is either as the beginning or originall of ſome, as the Aſcenſion, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding downe of the holy Ghoſt; or as the perfection, and conſummation of others, as of the Natiuitie, and Paſſion: And ſo generally, and <hi>virtute</hi> (as wee ſay) in vertue the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection contaynes the reſt, but it contaynes them not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly and expreſly, as it is neceſſary we ſhould remember them; for then we ſhould not need any moe Articles of our Creede, but that one of the Reſurrection. As the Articles are particular concerning the Natiuitie, Paſſion, Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Aſcenſion, ſo they ought to bee diſtinctly and ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally remembred, both on the Sabbath, and on other conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient times, which the Church ſhall appoint.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Although the Lords Day was not onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for a memoriall of the Reſurrection, yet, that was one of the principall cauſes wherefore it was ſanctified,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:26266:182"/>rather then any other day of the weeke. Saint <hi>Anguſtine</hi> ſayes as before, <hi>Domini reſurrectio conſecrauit nobis diem Dominicum, dies Dominicus ſacratus est, &amp; declaratus Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtireſurrectione, &amp; inde coepit habere feſtiuitatem ſuam.</hi> And in <hi>Tertullian</hi> his time, it was indeed eſteemed a thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, eyther to faſt or kneele vpon the Lords Day, which cuſtome was confirmed in the Councell of Nice, <hi>Can.</hi> 20. When ye ſay, that if it were appointed for remembrance of Chriſts Reſurrection, all the diuine Seruice done on the Lords Day, ſhould haue relation only to the Reſurrection; It is no conſequent: for albeit God bleſſed, and ſanctified the Iewiſh Sabbath, becauſe hee reſted thereon, there were yet other Scriptures read on their Sabbath, then the ſtorie of Creation, and God his reſt from it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, where ye alledge, that it was called the Lords Day, becauſe it was inſtituted by the Lord and for the Lord, we will not contend about this, prouiding it be not denyed, that it is called the Lords Day principally, becauſe the Lord roſe thereupon, as <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and other Ancients af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme euery-where. The Communion is called the Lords Supper, becauſe hee appointed it to be kept for a memoriall of his death till his comming againe. The Iewiſh Sabbath was called the Sabbath of the Lord their God, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was conſecrated to his worſhip: for then the New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moones, and all the other Feſtiuall Dayes ſhould haue beene ſo named, which they are not; but alſo becauſe it was the ſigne and memoriall of Gods reſt that Day. Therefore in the fourth Command, it is expreſſed as the reaſon, why the Lord did bleſſe and ſanctifie the Sabbath, <hi>He reſted the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth Day, therefore</hi> (namely, becauſe hee reſted on it) <hi>hee bleſſed and hallowed it:</hi> euen ſo is the Sonday ſanctified and bleſſed by our Sauiour, and called the Lords Day, becauſe it hath imprinted in it by his Inſtitution a perpetuall memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of his Reſurrection, whereby hee aboliſhed all the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baticall ſhad dowes of the Law; as firſt, the ſtrict and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe bodily reſt, by bringing in, the ſpirituall and eternall:
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:26266:183"/>Secondly, the memoriall of their temporall deliuerance out of Egypt, by bringing in the eternall and ſpirituall deliuery from the tyrannie of Satan, the ſlauerie of ſin, and the ſeare of death: and thirdly, the ſigne and marke of diſtinction which ſeparated the Iew and Gentile, and was a part of the partition wall, in reſpect whereof, the Iewes were called <hi>Sabbatarij;</hi> all theſe ſhaddowes Chriſt by his Reſurrection ath a boliſhed, and by the obſeruation of the Lords Day, they are declared to bee aboliſhed; which the obſeruation of no other day of the weeke could haue done, becauſe Chriſt ſtamped none of them with the memoriall of his Reſurrection, but this Day only whereupon he roſe.</p>
                  <p>Againſt this ye alledge, that it is not <hi>typus deſtinatus,</hi> but <hi>communis &amp; factus,</hi> that is, a Type not inſtituted by God to be a memoriall of Chriſts Reſurrection, but a common Type fitted to reſemble ſuch a thing: the contrary whereof is true. For nothing can bee called a common Type, but that which hath in it ſelfe by nature, ſome reſpect, or qualitie, wherby it is fitted to make the reſemblance of ſuch a thing: As in Marriage, in the comunction of the head and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, there is a fitneſſe naturall to reſemble our vnion with Chriſt: So in the Piſmire there is a qualitie naturall, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the vertuous man; and in the Lion and Horſe, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the ſtrong and ſtately: but in this day by nature, there is neither qualitie nor reſpect more, then in any other to make ſuch a reſemblance. Moreouer, common Types are neither memorial &amp; prognoſticall ſignes, but demonſtratiue only; &amp; all memoriall, &amp; prognoſticall ſignes, which are not naturall, are ſignes deſtinate either by God or by man. If ye affirme, that the Lords Day was deſtinate by man, to be a ſigne of Chriſts Reſurrection, then yee muſt grant, that it was inſtituted by man to bee obſerued in remembrance of that benefit, and ſo it ſhall not be a day of Diuine, but hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Inſtitution. Laſtly, all the times which God hath mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with ſome rare worke or euent, and hath therefore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to bee obſerued ſolemnely, haue euer beene deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:26266:183"/>by God to be memoratiue ſignes of theſe ſame things. So the ſeuenth Day marked with Gods reſt, and therefore bleſſed and ſanctified, is a memoriall of Gods reſt, and is called the Sabbath of <hi>Iehouah,</hi> and it is alſo a prognoſticall ſigne of the reſt of God to be communicated with the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full who reſemble that reſt by a corporall ceſſation. This the Apoſtle witneſſeth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.9. <hi>There remaynes therefore a reſt to the people of God, for hee that enters into his rest, hee alſo ceaſes from his owne workes, as God did from his.</hi> In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the fourteenth day of the firſt Moneth marked with that rare deliuerance from the deſtroying Angell, and their eſcape out of Egypt, and therefore appointed to be ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerued to the honour of God: was deſtinated by God to bee a memoriall of that their deliuerance, and called the Paſſeouer of the Lord. And euen ſo the Lords Day being marked with that rare and incompatable benefit of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and conſecrated in the iudgement of all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients to the worſhip of God inſteed of the Iewiſh Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, is a memoriall ſigne of the Reſurrection deſtinated by the Lord himſelfe; a demonſtratiue ſigne of our ſpirituall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from ſinne, to newneſſe of life; and a prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſigne of our corporeall Reſurrection vnto euerlaſting life. This Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> expreſſeth in the words before cited: <hi>Dominicus dies Christi reſurrectione ſacratus, aeternam non ſolum ſpiritus, ſed etiam corporis requiem praeſigurat.</hi> In end where yee conclude, that the Lords Day was not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed only for a remembrance of his Reſurrection after a myſticall manner, but for the remembrance of all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and worſhip in generall, if your meaning bee, that on the Lords Day, all Chriſts actions may and ought to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly remembred, as occaſion requires, and not his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction only, it is true that yee ſay: but if your meaning bee, that the ſanctification of the Lords Day was not ordayned to be a memoriall of Chriſts Reſurrection, I deny your aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; preferre to your opinion, the iudgement of all the Ancients.</p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:26266:184"/>
                  <p>Vnto that which yee ſubioyne, that it is a ſuperſtitious wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip, and a Iudaicall addition to Chriſts Inſtitution, to diuide Chriſts actions, and appoint Anniuerſary and Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call dayes for their remembrance; I reply, that it is a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious wil-worſhip indeed, and a Iudaicall addition to Chriſts Inſtitution, ſo to tye all the worſhip of God to the Lords Day, that no other day nor time may bee appointed for preaching, praying or remembring any of Chriſts bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits: ſeeing vnder the Goſpell, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>De Baptiſmo, omnis dies Domini eſt, omnis hora, omne tempus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile eſt baptiſmo:</hi> that is, euery day is the Lords, euery houre, and euery time is fit for Baptiſme. If for Baptiſme, why not for Doctrine, and Prayer, and Thankeſgiuing, and all other parts of Gods Worſhip? For albeit the Lords Day be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to the Worſhip of God, yet the Worſhip is not tied to it, but from one Sabbath to another, and from one New-Moone to another, all fleſh may appeare before the Lord. That which ye ſpeake of diuiding Chriſts actions, and the appointing of myſticall dayes, is partly fooliſh, and partly falſe. Is it not a folly to thinke, that the actions of Chriſt ought not to bee diuided, and ſeuerally remembred in Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures and Sermons, ſeeing the Spirit of God hath diuided them in this Storie, and that it is impoſſible at once to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them all? And it is falſe alſo, becauſe for remembe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of them no day is appointed to bee kept myſtically as a part of the worſhip, but only circumſtantially for order, and commoditie: which kinde of obſeruation is not a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious wil-worſhip, but a lawfull determination of commodious times for the worſhip of God, belonging to the power and policie of the Church.</p>

                  <p>If it was the Iewiſh Pentecoſt, then Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did not only obſerue an Anniuerſary Day, but ſuch alſo, as
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:26266:184"/>was legall, and abrogated by the Goſpell, and ſuch as hee diſcharges the Church to obſerue: Yet I hope, yee will not ſay, that his obſeruation was Superſtitious or Pedagogicall, becauſe he obſerued it not as a neceſſary part of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip preſcribed in the Law, in reſpect whereof only, it was Pedagogicall; but as a fit circumſtance and opportunitie for the worke of his Miniſterie, like as he did often obſerue the Iewiſh Sabbaths, which was not onely lawfull, but in thoſe times verie expedient to be done by him. Hereby it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that the obſeruation of dayes, is not condemued by the Apoſtle, as a Iewiſh Rite, becauſe Anniuerſarie, Monethly, or Weekly; but becauſe it was conioyned with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of neceſſitie, and vſed as a Legall worſhip: therefore although vpon the Iewiſh Sabbath, or vpon their Pentecoſt diuine worſhip was performed, as the Euangell preached, the Sacraments celebrated, Prayers publikely conceiued, &amp;c. If theſe things were done, without any myſticall rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or reſpect had to the day, but only becauſe the time was opportune and happily fit for Gods Worke, the exerciſe was lawfull and could not bee condemned. So wee finde in ſome churches, that on euery day the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was miniſtred: that on the Iewiſh Sabbath, they had an ordinarie Faſt, and no well aduiſed Chriſtian did euer thinke theſe to be vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, by reaſon of the day. For if <hi>to the cleane, euery thing be cleane,</hi> all dayes are cleane and ſanctified to euery lawfull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the man who is himſelfe made cleane by the bloud of Chriſt: Conſequently, euery day, whether it be Weekly or Anniuerſarie, is cleane, and ſanctified by Chriſt, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of any part of his Worſhip, which ſhall bee thought meete by the Church to be performed to his honour, and the edification of her ſelfe. The Legall Sabbath and Pentecoſt, which were abrogated, could not make the Euangelicke Worſhip, which was performed on them by the Apoſtles, vnlawfull; farre leſſe can the Lords Day, ſuch as the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Paſche, and Whitſonday are, or any other day of the Weeke, Moneth, or Yeare, which were neuer legally obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:26266:185"/>make the Doctrine, Prayers, and Sacraments admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred on them, vnlawfull, and ſuperſtitious.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, I finde in this Obiection a Solution to all your Arguments, for here I find, that there may be a lawfull obſeruation of dayes which are abrogated, let be of dayes which are not diſcharged, ſo the obſeruation bee not legall, with opinion of neceſſitie, or of any myſterie in the time: but Euangelicali, with knowledge of our Chriſtian libertie, and for opportunitie of time onely, which both may bee lawfull and expedient. So Saint <hi>Paul</hi> keeped many Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, and the Pentecoſt, whereon Saint <hi>Peter</hi> alſo conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted three thouſand by his firſt preaching. This is the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, for which only we ſtand; againſt which, ye haue ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer concluded a contradictory, but either againſt the Legall of the Iewiſh, or ſuperſtitious of the Gentiles. So all your Arguments fall vnder one forme of <hi>Caption</hi> which wee call <hi>ignorantia Elenchi,</hi> when a contradiction ſeemes to bee, where there is none, becauſe the tearmes in the apparant contradiction are not taken in the ſame ſenſe.</p>

The teſtimonie of the 118. Pſalme, yee ſay ſhould be applyed to euery Lords Day, but ſeeing he roſe on the firſt day of them, as yee cannot deny, doubtleſſe when that day returnes by courſe once euery yeare; vnto it, all the prototype and archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type of them all, of very congruity, ſaies the Biſhop, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection is to be applyed ſomwhat more. This by example he makes plain. His Maieſties deliuerance vpon the fift dayes of <hi>August,</hi> and <hi>Nouember</hi> being Tueſdayes both, wee keepe for their remembrance a Sermon on Tueſday euery week of the yeare: but when by courſe of the yeare in their ſeuerall moneths, the very originall dayes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues come about, ſhal we not, doe wee not celebrate them in much more ſolemne manner? what queſtion is there? weigh them well, ye ſhal find the caſe alike; one cannot be, but the other alſo muſt bee A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolike. Theſe are the words of the learned Biſhop, which proue his intent ſo cleerly, that ye are forced to flye to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhift, as your cuſtome is, &amp; ſay, If the Propheſie ſhould be applyed to any preciſe day, it ſhould bee applyed to the Lords day. But ſeeing the words are to be vnderſtood aſwel of <hi>Dauid</hi> as of Chriſt, the day is taken, ye ſay, for the time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely, wherin <hi>Dauid</hi> was made King, &amp; the corner ſtone of Gods people. This is your ſhift, which cannot auaile you: for if it be taken indefinitely for the day wherin <hi>Dauid</hi> was made the typick corner Stone, then much more muſt it bee taken for the definite day, whereon Chriſt the Veritie was made the true corner Stone of the Church of God. If of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi> Coronation, it might be ſaid, <hi>This is the day which the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:26266:186"/>Lord hath made, Let vs reioyce and bee glad in it:</hi> much more is it to be ſaid of that day, whereon CHRIST roſe againe from the dead, and was crowned with glory and honour, and ſet ouer the workes of Gods hands, and had all things put vnder his feet. For this day hath euer beene e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed ſince the reſurrection of our Lord, a day made by God, not by creation onely, but alſo by inſtitution.

Otherwiſe, euerie day is the Lords, euerie houre, and euerie time is meete for Baptiſme. The ſolemnitie may be leſſe, but the grace is not diminiſhed. So that which ye ſay, that Baptiſme was tied of olde to Pentecoſt and Eaſter, is falſe.

                  <p>I will now frame one argument againſt this conceit of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall tradition, and obſeruation of Paſche. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were led all their life-time by the infallible direction of the Spirit. If they had accorded on the obſeruation of Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, they had not diſagreed on the day. But their moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Records, the baſtard-Epiſtles aboue mentioned report, that <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> kept the fourteenth day of the Moone, as the Iewes did: And <hi>Peter,</hi> the Lords Day following the fourteenth day of the Moone.</p>

                  <p>In theſe Epiſtles there is no mention of <hi>Peter,</hi> and ſo by theſe Epiſtles, ye cannot proue, that <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on the day. It is ſaid that <hi>Polycarpus</hi> and <hi>Anicetus</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreed on the day, yet they accorded in the obſeruation of the Feaſt, which is directly contrarie to your argument. But ye ſay, the Apoſtles who were gouerned by the Spirit, could not diſagree on the day. Did not <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> agree in planting of the Goſpell? yet they diſagreed in chuſing of their Fellow-Labourer. <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Peter</hi> agreed on this ground, that a man is not iuſtified by the workes of the Law, but by the Faith of Ieſus Chriſt: yet in the practiſe of the workes of the Law, they diſagreed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. They agreed in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, yet in the matter of circumſtance, and vſe of things in their owne nature indifferent, they diſagreed. But for theſe diuerſities of opinion, neither did they caſt the ſubſtance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, nor broke they the bond of charitie amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, as ye doe, who can brooke no man, but him who will be ſworne to your opinions, as if they were Oracles. But to be ſhort, this argument is anſwered by the learned Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op in that Sermon ſo fully, as may giue contentment to any that delights not in contention. His words are theſe, Pag. 25. <hi>Iames Biſhop of Ieruſalem, and others who ſucceeded him, the ſooner to win their Brethren, the Iewes, condeſcended to keepe Eaſter</hi> 14. <hi>Luna, the</hi> 14. <hi>of the Moone, as they did. That
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:26266:187"/>which by them was done by way of condeſcenſion, was after by ſome vrged as a matter of neceſſitie.</hi> So we ſee S. <hi>Paul</hi> when he came vp to Ieruſalem to the Pentecoſt, was counſailed or not ſcandalizing the Iewes, to carrie himſelfe as one that obſerued the Law, and practiſe ſome legall ceremonies to that effect: which he did, vſing them not as a part of diuine worſhip, but as indifferent things, and meanes expedient to win him credite with the Iewes, that hee might edifie them in the truth. So himſelfe ſayes, <hi>He became all things to all men, that he might winne ſome.</hi> The keeping of the 14. day by <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> is not an argument that they diſagreed from the reſt in iudgement, touching the ſet day (if any then was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined) more then the practiſe of other ceremonies proues their diſagreeing from S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the poynt of Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie: for this they did onely by way of condeſcenſion. So the Apoſtles in theſe times might haue kept Eaſter vpon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe daies, by the direction of the Spirit, becauſe the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne commemoration of our Sauiours reſurrection, which we call Eaſter, is not to be kept at any ſet time for any myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that one day hath more then another by diuine inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The contentions therefore about the day were iuſtly bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the reformed Churches, who acknowledge no day, except the Chriſtian Sabbath, to haue greater prerogatiue then anothen. But the greater part of the world keeping the ſolemnitie of Eaſter vpon the Lords Day, which followed the 14. of the Moone, the Churches of Aſia being a fewer num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, did not well to preferre the ſingularitie of their opinion and cuſtome to vnitie and conformitie with the greater part of Chriſtendome in ſuch a poynt. Againe, <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of Rome cannot bee excuſed, who firſt did vrge conformitie, &amp; preſſed it by violence vpon the Churches that were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Iuriſdiction; and to excommunicate them, was an inſolent tyrannie, ſeeing they were not ſubiect to his power. Yet after the Nicene Councell had ſetled that controuerſie, and determined the day, theſe muſt iuſtly be blamed, that contentiouſly troubled the Chriſtian peace, diſobeyed the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:26266:188"/>Canon of the Councell, and were diſconforme to the reſt of the Churches, not by miſtaking the day as ſome were, but through wilfulneſſe and pride, the parents of contention.</p>

                     <hi>Socrates,</hi> in the teſtimonie which yee alledge, lib. 5. cap. 22. for probation of your anſwere, ſayes, that he is of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that the Feaſt of Eaſter hath preuailed amongſt people of a certaine priuate cuſtome, and not by Canon. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes his opinion by this reaſon, that they who keepe Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter on the 14. day of the Moone, bring <hi>Iohn</hi> the Apoſtle for their author. Such as inhabite Rome, and the Weſt parts of the World, alledge <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and yet there is none of them can ſhew in Writing any teſtimonie for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of their cuſtome. Firſt here it is to bee marked, that <hi>Socrates</hi> in this teſtimonie calls his allegation an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion onely, that is, a likely and probable conceit: but that is not ſufficient to infringe Saint <hi>Auguſtines</hi> rule, and the probations that he brings are of no force: for firſt, it makes nothing againſt <hi>Auguſtines</hi> rule, that the Eaſterne Churches kept the ſolemnitie on one day, and the Weſterne on another: becauſe Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayes not that the commemoration of theſe benefits was made vpon one and the ſelfe-ſame day: onely hee ſayes, <hi>Anniuerſaria ſolennitaie
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:26266:188"/>celebrantur,</hi> that is, They are yearely celebrated after a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne manner. The diuerſitie of the day conſuteth not this aſſertion, but confirmes rather his ſaying: namely, that the ſolemnitie was obſerued through all the World, ſeeing in one part it was celebrated for winning of the Iewes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the practiſe of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and in the reſt of the World, on Paſche Sonday, whereon our Sauiour roſe, according to the tradition of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> the Apoſtle of the Gentiles. So this ſame ſolemnitie being kept through the whole Church, although not on the ſame day, Saint <hi>Auguſtines</hi> rule remains good, that the ſolemne commemoration of Chriſts reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, is Apoſtolicke.</p>
                  <p>The next probation is no better, to wit, that there is no teſtimonie in writing for the confirmation of that cuſtome: for by this reaſon it would follow, that the obſeruation of Sonday in ſtead of the Iewiſh Sabbath, hath preuayled by a priuate cuſtome only: For in the Apoſtolique writings, we haue no teſtimonie for the confirmation of that cuſtome. In Scripture we reade, that our Sauiour roſe on that day, that on that day he appeared to his Diſciples, that on that day the Apoſtle appointed collections to be made for the poore, that on that day at Troas the Diſciples were aſſembled to breake bread, and that S. <hi>Paul</hi> preached: All theſe actions make aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well for the obſeruation of Paſche Sonday, and as the Biſhop of Wincheſter ſaith, ſomewhat more, ſeeing it is after a ſort, the ſame day by reuolution, whereon our Sauiour did riſe: yet all theſe practiſes, exerciſes, and meetings on the Lords day had not demonſtrate the ſanctification of it, if it had not beene perpetually and vniuerſally obſerued after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the Church. This conſtant and vniuerſall obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, hath declared theſe practiſes to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarie, and that our Sauiour did conſecrate that day by his reſurrection, and apparitions, to be in ſtead of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.

Hee had not the occaſion: yet <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who flouriſhed but fortie yeares after him, in the ſecond booke directed to his wife, hath theſe wordes: <hi>Quis deni<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>
                           </am>

                        </expan> ſolennibus Paſchae abnoctantem ſeeurus ſuſtinet?</hi> And in his booke, <hi>De Praeſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionib. aduerſ. Haereticos,</hi> mentions one <hi>Blastus,</hi> whom hee calls an Heretike, for maintayning that Paſche ſhould bee kept on the 14. day of the Moone, as the Iewiſh cuſtome was. <hi>Tertullian</hi> flouriſhed in the yeare of our Lord 183. and ſpeaking thus of Paſche, not, as of a new Conſtitution, but as of a cuſtome long before receiued in the Church, does confirme the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> his iudgement, That in all likelihood this obſeruation was Apoſtolique. By A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolique, I meane not a doctrinall point, which is to bee obſerued as a ſubſtantiall part of diuine worſhip, or a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition neceſſary to ſaluation, but the imitation onely of an Apoſtolique practice concerning order and policie: neither doe I meane ſuch a practice as is expreſly ſet down in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:26266:189"/>and vniuerſally obſerued through the world, ſuch as the Lords Day is, for ſuch a practice hath the ſtrength of a diuine Precept: but I vnderſtand ſuch a practice, as albeit it be not recorded in Scripture, to haue beene done by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles themſelues, or the Churches in their time, yet the ſame being vniuerſally receiued in the world, and obſerued ſince the Apoſtles dayes, is moſt probably preſumed to haue beene practiſed in their times, and allowed by them. And in this, the Lords Day differs from Paſche, and the other three dayes mentioned by Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that the Lords Day hath not onely the vniuerſall and perpetuall obſeruation of the Church, ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles, but alſo the practice of our Sauiour, his Apoſtles, and the Church in their times expreſly recorded in Scripture: The other haue onely an vniuerſall and conſtant practice of the Church, ſince the Apoſtles time, which not the leſſe ought to be preferred to any priuate or late particular cuſtome. And to returne to the Act of Perth, it ordaynes none of theſe dayes to be kept for Diuine and Apoſtolique, but onely, that on them once in the yeare a ſolemne commemoration be made of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of our Redemption; and therefore the Reaſons ye bring to proue, that theſe dayes are not Apoſtolique, impugne no wayes the lawfulneſſe of the act. Where yee ſay, that the obſeruation of the Paſſion day, hath brought into the Church ſet dayes of faſting, condemned by our Diuines, I aske you, how yee doe proue that affirmation? It is enough yee haue ſaid it. But to conclude this point, I doe verily thinke, That to faſt and pray at ſome ſet times, were leſſe offenſiue to God, then to bee often feaſting and ſurfetting, pratling, and lying, traducing our Brethren, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the good order and policie of Gods Church.</p>

                  <p>It is commonly obiected, That wee may aſwell keepe a day for the Natiuitie, as for the Reſurrection of Chriſt. We haue anſwered already, That Chriſts day or the Lords Day, is the day appointed for remembrance of his Natiuitie, and all his actions and benefits, aſwell as for the Reſurrection. Next, the one is morall and weekely: the other, is myſticall and anniuerſarie. The Lords Day it ſelfe, is no longer to vs myſticall but morall, ſayes <hi>Willet,</hi> and therefore Paſche day is a myſticall Sabbath and anniuerſarie, whereas the Lords Day it ſelfe ſhould be onely morall.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>ANS.</speaker>
                  <p>The anſwere which yee haue already made, is already confuted. The Lords Day is generally appointed for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of all his actions, therefore none of his actions may or ſhould bee remembred at any other ſet time. This conſequence is not neceſſary: for then we may not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his actions, in the morning and euening Lectures, wee may not remember them in Sermons &amp; Exerciſes on week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dayes, nor may wee remember them in Catechizing the people. Your next anſwere is, That the day of the Natiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is myſticall: This is contrarie to that which yee cited out of Saint <hi>Augustine, pag.</hi> 68. <hi>Ille celebratur ob memoriam ſolùm, &amp; ideo ſemper die vigeſimo quinto Decembris: at iste celebratur ob memoriam, &amp; Sacramentum.</hi> But, I pray you, How proue yee obſeruation of the day of Natiuitie to bee myſticall? becauſe it is anniuerſarie, yee ſay: If this be your Argument (for I finde no other here) it is not good: for in the reuolution of time there is no myſterie, but in the ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:26266:191"/>and we haue often ſaid before, that we obſerue no day for ſignification, but the Lords Day onely. The reſt we obſerue as times meet and commodious, for the worſhip appointed to be done on them. As to Doctor <hi>Willets</hi> aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That the Lords Day is not myſticall to vs, I oppone to it Saint <hi>Auguſtines</hi> iudgement, who calls it, as yee heard before, a figure and type of life eternall, which is confirmed by the Apoſtle in the fourth to the Hebrewes. But Doctor <hi>Willet,</hi> I hope, takes <hi>(myſticall)</hi> for a darke and obſcure ſhadow of things to come, ſuch as the feſtiuall dayes vnder the Law were, kept in remembrance, not of ſpirituall and eternall, but of temporall benefits, which were ſhadowes of ſpirituall and eternall benefits to come: And in this ſenſe, the Lords Day is not myſticall, for it is not kept in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of temporall benefits, which are ſhadowes of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and eternall, but in remembrance of Chriſts Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by whom we are put in preſent poſſeſſion of our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall reſt and life, and in hope of eternall. In reſpect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as it is a memoriall ſigne of the Reſurrection of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, ſo is is a demonſtratiue ſigne of the benefit which wee enjoy of ſpirituall reſt, and prognoſticall of our eternall, and therefore is called a figure and type, by Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine.</hi> Thus taking a myſterie in a large ſenſe for any ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant ſigne in Religion, it may be called myſticall. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the new Teſtament are called myſteries by the Ancients, not in the ſenſe that the Sacraments of the old Teſtament were called myſteries, for they were ſo called, becauſe they were darke and obſcure ſhadowes of things to come; but our Sacraments are the liuely Images of the things themſelues, by reaſon of the plaine and manifeſt Word of the Goſpell annexed to them. By this diſtinction Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and Doctor <hi>Willet</hi> may be agreed.</p>

                  <p>Wee thinke it ſufficient to haue made that obiection once, becauſe it hath neuer yet beene anſwered: but yee propone it often to aſſay, if yee ſhall bee able to fall on ſome ſolide ſolution at laſt; yet like an euill Archer, the longer yee ſhoote, yee ſtray the further from the marke: Yee thinke an Anniuerſarie remembrance may be kept, but an Anniuerſarie ſolemnitie ſhould not bee celebrated: yee hide your minde from ſimple people vnder a myſticall ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnitie of words, but to ſpeake that plainly, which yee call the celebration of an Anniuerſarie ſolemnitie, your meaning muſt be, if yee contradict the Act, that preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould not bee made, prayers, thankſgiuing, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſhould not be offered on certayne ſet times in the yeare, in remembrance of Chriſts Natiuitie, Paſſion, &amp;c. If yee will haue no ſuch exerciſe to bee vſed, what Anniuerſarie remembrance is it that yee would haue obſerued? Is it a priuy meditation in our Chambers, whereunto neither God nor Man is priuie, or ſome occaſionall remembrance in our Lectures and Sermons, as they fall out now and then? Is this the thankfulneſſe that wee are taught by the light of Nature and the Word of God, to render for the ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble benefits of our redemption, which God hath vniuerſally and publikely beſtowed vpon all?</p>
                  <p>Oh, but to keepe a Sabbath of reſt in remembrance, ſay yee, is a pedagogicall ceremonie. To keepe a myſticall reſt, ſuch as the reſt of the Sabbath was, is pedagogicall: but to keepe a reſt for the more commodious and ſolemne perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:26266:192"/>of a great and diuine action, ſuch as the commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Chriſts Birth, Death, &amp;c. is not pedagogicall, but neceſſary for the commoditie, and celebritie of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which cannot bee well and worthily performed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceſſation from other ſeruile buſineſſe. That this is the vſe of the reſt commanded in his Maieſties Proclamation, is manifeſt by the reaſons ſet downe therein, in theſe words: That <hi>euery one may the better attend the holy exerciſes, which are to bee kept in the Church on theſe times.</hi> Yee are cunning to deceiue the ſimple with ambiguitie of words. There is a reſt that is ciuilly kept, which is a ceſſation from our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary workes for ſome other ciuill employment, as for marriages, triumphs, weapon-ſhewings, and ſuch like; this reſt is lawfull, but it is not Sabbaticall. There is a reſt kept ſuperſtitiouſly, as when men ceaſſe from their labours, for ſome fooliſh feares of ill ſucceſſe, by reaſon of the time: this is not called a Sabbath of reſt, but a ſuperſtitious reſt. There is a reſt kept idolatrouſly for the honour of idols, as the <hi>Bacchanalia, Floralia,</hi> and the holy dayes proclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Iſraelites, for honour of their golden Calfe: Theſe are damnable reſts. Finally, there is a reſt that is kept religiouſly, and this reſt is kept either for celebritie and commoditie of the religious action onely, or myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally: for commoditie and celebritie of the religious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, a reſt is kept in all the ſolemne times of faſting: a reſt is kept in the houres of Prayers, or Preaching, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diuine Seruice. And ſuch is the reſt, that his Maieſtie hath appointed to bee obſerued. The reſt, kept myſtically, was a ſignificant reſt of ſome thing by-paſt, preſent, or to come; ſuch was the reſt of the Iewiſh Sabbath, and of the Legall Feſtiuities, and ſuch <hi>Auguſtine</hi> holds, and other many good Diuines, our reſt on the Lords Day to be, from the fourth to the Hebrewes. This is called a Sabbath of reſt, ſuch a reſt his Maieſtie hath not commanded; but a reſt for commoditie and celebritie of the diuine Seruice only, which
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:26266:192"/>in nothing is like to the Iewes Frontlets, Phylacteries, and ſuch other Legall ſhadowes.</p>

                  <p>Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the third gaue this reaſon, wherefore the Romane Church kept not a Holy day to the Trinitie, <hi>Quoniam Eccleſia Romana in vſu non habet, &amp;c.</hi> Becauſe, ſayes he, Glorie to the Father, and to the Sonne, and to the holy Ghoſt, and other ſuch like things, belonging to the praiſe of the Trinitie, are daily vttered. The Popes reaſon is grounded vpon this rule, Whatſoeuer is intreated or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred in the diuine ſeruice ordinarie, ought not to haue a ſpeciall Holy day, to celebrate the memorie of the ſame, beſide the day alreadie decerned by the Lord. We aſſume, Chriſts Natiuitie, Death, Reſurrection, &amp;c. are not onely the continuall meditation of a Chriſtian in priuate, but alſo a remembred, and intreated in the ordinarie and publique ſeruice. Euery Communion Sonday is a Paſſion Holy day. Euery Sabbath, that Chriſts Natiuitie is preached, is a time of remembrance of his Natiuitie. But to ordayne an Anniuerſarie day, or houre of reſt, for commemoration of his Natiuitie or Paſſion, and ſpecially vpon a weeke day, is a Iewiſh rudiment, and a preiudice to Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie.</p>

                  <p>I anſwere to the Propoſition firſt, and I grant, that whatſoeuer is remembred in the ordinarie diuine ſeruice, ordinarily and particularly, ſuch as, <hi>Glory bee to the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost,</hi> which was ſaid in the diuine ſeruice ordinarily and particularly, that needes not any particular commemoration vpon ſome ſpeciall time, ſayes Pope <hi>Alexander:</hi> but the ineſtimable benefits and actions of our Sauiour, which were not ordinarily and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly remembred in the daily ſeruice, but onely in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſall of the Creede, where all the Articles of Religion are remembred; Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> thought, that for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:26266:193"/>of theſe, a ſet time was neceſſary. So the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, which is your ground, being taken according to the Popes minde, is againſt you.</p>
                  <p>Next, I anſwere, your Aſſumption is falſe: Theſe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits are not the continuall meditation of Chriſtians in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate; for I am aſſured, if yee bee a Chriſtian, yee did not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on theſe things Chriſtianly, when yee did meditate this Pamphlet againſt the honour of Chriſt his Paſſion, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, and againſt the power of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, where yee ſay, That they are remembred in the ordinarie and publique ſeruice, that falleth out ſometimes, but not purpoſely. When it happens, it is by occaſion, and generally that they are touched, becauſe they occurre in your Text perhaps. Otherwiſe, they may lye buried ſeuen yeares before they be purpoſely remembred. And when yee ſay, That euery Communion Sonday is a Paſſion Holy day, I would demand, whether it were lawfull on the Sater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day or Friday before that Communion Sonday, to make a Sermon on the Paſſion for preparation of the people to the Communion, as I hope, you haue practiſed ſometime your ſelfe. Now, if this, which your ſelfe and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue done, bee lawfull, is it not lawfull alſo to doe the like on Friday before Eaſter, which is a Communion Sonday by the acts of our Church? And this is all, that they ordayned by the Act of the Aſſembly at Perth, touching the remembrance of the Paſſion. Further, to that which yee ſay, That euery Sabbath whereon the Natiuitie is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is a time of remembrance of his Natiuitie: I anſwere, That it is but occaſionall, and ſo falls out by the Text which the Miniſter teaches; but neither doe the people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort purpoſely to Church to heare the Natiuitie intreated at that time, nor does the Miniſter intreat of it at large, as the ſame ought.</p>
                  <p>Finally, yee conclude with that often repeated calumnie,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:26266:193"/>that to ordayne a certayne anniuerſary day, or houre of reſt, for commemoration of theſe benefits, is a Iewiſh rudiment, and a preiudice to Chriſtian libertie. The firſt is falſe: For the appointing of houres and times weekely, monethly, or yearely, for preaching any part of the Goſpell, is no Iewiſh rudiment, but a lawfull, good, and wiſe Chriſtian policie, practiſed 1500. yeares before yee were borne, throughout the whole Chriſtian world, and allowed by the beſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines both in the primitiue and reformed Church. So farre is it from being a preiudice to Chriſtian libertie, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a principall part of our libertie conſiſts, that we are not aſtricted in the worſhip of God to Times, Places, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and others ſuch circumſtances by the Goſpell, but haue libertie to chooſe and appoint ſuch as wee thinke moſt expedient for the honour of God, and edification of his people: of the which libertie the purpoſe of your Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet is to ſpoile vs, in the Sacrament aſtricting vs to the geſture of ſitting onely, and for Gods publique worſhip, to the Lords Day onely; as if the Church had no power to appoint preaching, prayers, and diuine ſeruice to be done at any other time, or the Sacrament to bee receiued in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faſhion.</p>

                  <p>We worſhippe not Chriſt by obſeruation of the day, but by the obſeruation of an euangelicke and lawfull worſhippe done to him vpon the day.

                  <p>Your aſſumption muſt be this. But to make commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ineſtimable benefits of our redemption vpon the fiue anniuerſarie daies, hath beene aboliſhed lawfully by ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and Eccleſiaſticall Lawes, &amp;c. This aſſumption is falſe, in all the parts of it; for firſt, as we haue ſhewed the, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation ordayned by the Act at Perth was neuer aboliſhed by Ciuill or Eccleſiaſticall Lawes, nor yet by conſent and vniforme practiſe of the contrarie: Onely the ſuperſtitious obſeruation of theſe dayes with opinion of neceſſitie, as a part of diuine worſhip, and the profane abuſe thereof, with exceſſiue banqueting, playing, and carroling was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Secondly, to your preſcription of time in things moue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, I anſwer, that circumſtantiall ceremonies belonging to Religion, are alwaies alterable, and neither can bee aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed nor eſtabliſhed by preſcription: for if preſcription had force in ſuch things, then the ſpace of 1200. yeares, during which time theſe fine dayes were obſerued vniuerſally throughout the whole Chriſtian world, ſhould haue greater force to eſtabliſh the obſeruation of them, then the abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſeuen and fiftie yeares in durance onely. Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of time does not eſtabliſh without change ſuch things, but giues occaſion to alter them rather, when the alteration makes for the honour of God, the edification of his Church, and auoyding corruption. Thirdly, the Sermons of reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Preachers condemned onely, the ſuperſtitious and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane obſeruation of theſe dayes, and not the obſeruation made by the Primitiue, and by the reformed Churches in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:26266:197"/>our time, which is the obſeruation onely commaunded by the Act of Perthe. Fourthly, If any were cenſured, it was not for any fault in the action it ſelfe, but for tranſgreſſion of the Eccleſiaſticall order, and the ſcandall, which might haue followed thereupon; as the cenſures which wee now vſe againſt theſe, that refuſe to performe the diuine ſeruice appoynted to be done on theſe times, are not inflicted for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fault that is in omiſſion, in regard of the time, but onely in regard of the order and policie of the Church, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contemned, giues offence to the ſimple, and breaks peace and vnitie. Fiftly, we neuer abiured with oathes publique or priuate, the obſeruation now required; the dedication of dayes impoſed vpon the conſcience, with opinion that they are <hi>ſanctiores, &amp; ſacratiores alijs diebus, &amp; pars diuini cultus,</hi> we deteſt, and abiure: for nothing can be impoſed vpon the conſcience, but by the precept of God onely. The Canons of the Church in matters indifferent, doe not oblige the conſcience <hi>ratione rei praeceptae quaſi pars ſit aliqua aiuini cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus: ſed ordinis &amp; politias cauſa tantum.</hi> So the Canons of the Church made for obſeruation of theſe fiue dayes, bindes not the conſcience to the obſeruation thereof, as a part of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine worſhip, and as the commaundement of God bindes vs to the obſeruation of the Lords Day: for it is the will of God, that on the Lords Day, we be religiouſly exerciſed, and therefore our obedience in that point, is a part of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: but to be exerciſed in Gods publique worſhip on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother day, is not Gods expreſſe will, yet it is his will, that we ſhould heare the Church, and obey her ordinances in all things that tend to edification, and ſerue for good order, whereof God is the Author. To conclude, ſeeing the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of theſe fiue daies, as the ſame is preſcribed in the act at Perthe, is neither contrarie to any Law, Ciuill, or Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtique; nor condemned by the practice, doctrine, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of our Church, nor abiured by oathes: And therefore may lawfully be reſtored, receiued, and put in practiſe againe by our Church.</p>

Next, vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, becauſe they foſtered prophaneneſſe and ſuperſtition in the hearts of the people, who by want of information of Doctrine, did ſuperſtitiouſly or prophanely obſerue theſe dayes.

                  <p>Before the penner of this Pamphlet bring the iudgement of the reformed Churches, ſome reaſon he muſt pretend for
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:26266:199"/>his credite, why he reiects the doctrine and practiſe of the reformed Church, which ſtands wholly in his contrarie. Firſt he ſayes, that he hath ſpoken before of the Ancient Church. But what hath he ſpoken before? that they obſerued Eaſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day by cuſtome, and not by tradition, this is all. What ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument hath he brought againſt their doctrine, againſt their religious cuſtome and practiſe of this poynt? He ſayes, ſome excuſe them with their intention: Who be theſe? he is aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of their names, and ſo he may be; for where there is no fault, to make an excuſe is a ſort of calumnious and ſecret accuſation. But for their intention, who did acquaint him with their intention? In <hi>Tertullian, Chryſostome, Ierome, Ambroſe, Augustine,</hi> and others, who all make mention of theſe dayes, there is not ſo much as any coniecture to bee found for that intention. In the end he concludes, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Ancients hath proued folly, and this he ſayes, is manifeſt by the ſeuenth reaſon, becauſe the obſeruation of theſe daies hath beene abuſed to ſuperſtition. But ſo hath the Lords Day beene, ſo hath the Word, ſo haue the Sacraments beene abuſed, and all the other parts of Gods worſhip: Shall therefore the intention of the Holy-Ghoſt, and his wiſdome in preſcribing theſe meanes to the Church, be eſteemed fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? They who abuſe the good intention of God and his Church to their owne damnation, are fooles indeed, but <hi>Wiſdome is iustified of her owne children.</hi> And although the winning of the Gentiles was one good end, wherefore the Ancients obſerued theſe dayes, yet their principall end was the honour of God, and edification of his Church. Theſe ends doe ſtill remaine, and iuſtifie the obſeruation of theſe dayes by the reformed Churches, which no man that loues the honour of God, and the weale of his Church, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne.</p>

                  <p>It is groſſe ignorance to ſay, that Holy-dayes were ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundreth yeare before Papiſtrie: for Papiſtrie hath been in the Church euer ſince the daies of the Apoſtles: yea the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:26266:199"/>myſterie of iniquitie was working in their times. The errours of the Orthodoxe Church were the beginnings of Papiſtrie, at length they grew to a great maſſe. So howbeit, the whole lumpe was not formed, till the Antichriſt came to his full ſtrength, yet many particulars were entered before, and like brookes came into the great riuer. As the Antichriſt was borne, and did grow in yeares, ſo did Papiſtrie.</p>

                  <p>Here ye inſinuate, that the obſeruation of the fiue Daies in the Primitiue Church was Papiſtrie, or elſe this Diſcourſe is idle. But Papiſtrie it could not be, before it was receiued, and confirmed by the Pope: ſo in theſe dayes it was not Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtrie formally. And if it were not an errour of the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe Church, but a lawfull order, as at length we haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, it was neyther materially nor formally Papiſtrie. The obſeruation of theſe dayes, with a ſuperſtitious and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous worſhip, is Papiſtrie: Such was not the obſeruation of the Primitiue Church, and ſuch is not the obſeruation of the Reformed. But as the lawfull obſeruation vſed in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church was aboliſhed by the introduction of a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious and idolatrous worſhip in Papiſtrie, ſo is the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious and idolatrous obſeruation in Papiſtrie, aboliſhed in reformed Churches by the reſtitution of the lawfull and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious obſeruation vſed in the Primitiue Church, which of all reformations is the moſt perfect and profitable. <hi>Iehn</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed Idolatrie of the Heathen, but he reſtored not the true worſhip of God: therefore his reformation was imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. But the reformation made by <hi>Ezechias,</hi> and <hi>Ioſias,</hi> was perfect, becauſe Idolatrie was not onely aboliſhed, but the true worſhip of God eſtabliſhed in place thereof. This was not ſo ſufficiently prouided for at our reformation in this poynt, for the want of Paſtours, and is well ſupplied by the Act made at Perth.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, where ye alledge, that all the reformed Churches, haue abandoned the dayes dedicated to Saints: In this, their practiſe is no way contrarie to the Act made at Perth; for by it no day is ordained to be kept, which is or was dedicate to any Saint, except vnder the name of Saints yee reprehend him, who is the moſt holy.</p>
                  <p>Next, the exception ye make of our neighbour Church, is calumnious, and falſe. It is a calumnie, that they obſerue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny day dedicated to Saints. All the dayes which they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, are dedicated to the honour of God, either for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable benefits that by our Sauiour he hath beſtowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the World, or in regard of the bleſſings that haue come to man, by the Miniſtrie of his ſeruants, and Saints. And it is falſe, that all the reformed Churches, except they, haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed the obſeruation of theſe dayes: For <hi>Bullinger</hi> in his Commentary vpon the 14. to the <hi>Romans,</hi> affirmes, that the Church of Tigurie obſerues the Feaſts of the bleſſed Virgin, of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, of <hi>Magdalene,</hi> of <hi>Stephen,</hi> and of the Apoſtles.</p>

                  <p>To conclude then, to eſteeme one day aboue another, in reſpect of any myſtery, certainly knowne, or commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to haue beene wrought vpon that day; to teſtifie this eſtimation, by ceſſation from worke: To deuiſe a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſeruice to be done vpon it, accounting that forme or part of ſeruice acceptable to God, becauſe it is performed on that day: is to obſerue a day. And in this manner doe wee obſerue the Anniuerſarie dayes. The ſame reaſon may bee applyed to an Anniuerſary houre.</p>

                  <p>The Propoſition I admit, the Aſſumption I deny: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit any myſticall or memorable worke were certainly knowne to haue beene wrought vpon ſuch a time, yet to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme aboue another, except it were ſanctified by diuine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, wee count it Superſtition. So albeit wee certainly know the memorable workes of his Maieſties deliuerance
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:26266:203"/>to haue beene wrought vpon the fiſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and the fiſt of <hi>Nouember;</hi> yet we doe not eſteeme theſe dayes aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dayes, as if the ſeruice done on them, were more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, in reſpect of the time: but wee doe only eſteeme them as meete circumſtances for the thankeſgiuing appointed to be made on them to God. The ſame eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we haue of the fiue dayes, as wee haue oſt ſaid before.</p>
                  <p>That our Sauiour was borne vpon the 25. of <hi>December,</hi> no man (I thinke) knowes certainly: the common reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we hold as vncertaine. Therefore wee doe not thinke, the commemoration of Chriſts Natiuitie vpon that day, and our thankeſgiuing therefore more acceptable to God by reaſon of the day; nor doe wee thinke ceſſation from worke on that day a part of diuine worſhip, at it was held in time of Papiſtry, and is yet by many of our common Profeſſours that lacke inſtruction: but the worſhip we doe, is vnto God for his honour, not for the day; and the ceſſation from work is for the commoditie, and celebritie of the worſhip. The Act of Perth ordaynes the people to be thus inſtructed, and the ſuperſtitious conceite of the time rebuked. Finally, choice is made of this, and the other dayes, not for any my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie eſteemed to bee in them more then in other dayes, but for conformity with the Primitiue Church, the reuerence of whoſe authoritie in matters of this nature, muſt be of great force to draw Churches of diuers iuriſdictions that agree in doctrine, to vnity in points of externall policie: which vnity is far to be preferred to the priuate cuſtome of any Church, or the ſingularity of any mans opinion and fantaſie. And therefore ZANCHIVS ſaid well, and wiſely in the places cited before, That albeit the reformed Churches haue liberty to ſanctifie what dayes they thinke good, yet it is more laudable, honeſt, and profitable, to ſanctifie theſe which the moſt pure, Apoſtolick, and Primitiue Church ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified. So to conclude, we obſerue no day for myſtery, or with opinion of neceſſitie, but only for commodity and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie. And this obſeruation is approued by the iudgement of the beſt Diuines in the reformed Church.</p>

            <p>In the ſecond part of the diſpute, intituled, <hi>Biſhopping,</hi> he contends that the Sacrament of Confirmation and impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands, is not proper to Biſhops, but common to all Presbyters. This contention is idle: for the Sacrament of Confirmation and impoſition of hands, being refuted in the former diſpute by himſelfe, and condemned by the Act, why ſhould hee ſtriue to haue that common, which neither he nor we eſteeme to be lawfull? But to the end, all occaſion of debate, about this matter might be preuented, the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly at Perth ordayned, that the Biſhop after examination ſhould bleſſe the young children with prayer, and purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly omitted the ceremonie of impoſition of hands, as a thing indifferent to bee vſed, or not vſed, as the Biſhop ſhould thinke moſt meet: Albeit in the primitiue Church, this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing was alwayes giuen with impoſition of hands, as <hi>Caluine</hi> affirmes, <hi>Inſtit. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>ſect.</hi> 4. wiſhing that it were reſtored to the firſt integritie in the reformed Churches. Yet the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleter to make ſimple ones beleeue, that euery thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in that Aſſembly was erroneous, hee giues out, that the Sacrament, at leaſt the ceremonie of Confirmation was there allowed, and appropriated to Biſhops.</p>

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:26266:208"/>we cannot lawfully admit Epiſcopall Confirmation; giuing, and not granting their office were lawfull, and that they haue gotten a lawfull calling by the Church to the ſaid of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Thirdly, that we were free of our oath: and fourthly, That Confirmation were to be allowed, whether as a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie or as a Sacrament, yet it is damnable preſumption, to appropriate vnto themſelues the dutie that belongs to all Paftors.</p>

               <p>If by the Ceremonie or Sacrament of Confirmation, yee vnderſtand the miraculous impoſition of hands vſed by the Apoſtles, or yet the baſtard Sacrament of Confirmation v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Poperie, whereby <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> whom yee afterwards cire, ſayes, That the Lord would honour <hi>Epiſcopalem digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem:</hi> neither of theſe are allowed by the Act, nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to Biſhops. Therefore, your whole diſpute fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing being directed onely againſt theſe two points, is idle &amp; ſuperfluous. But if by Confirmation ye did vnderſtand ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaning of the Act, the dutie which Biſhops ſhould performe in trying at their Viſitation, the diligence of Paſtors in catechizing young children, and in cauſing them bee brought before them to bee examined and bleſſed: this part of Epiſcopall gouernment yee haue not abjured, but haue approued by your aſſertorie oath, and obliged your ſelfe to maintayne and obey by your promiſſorie oath; if ſo bee, yee did ſweare to the Policie ſet downe in the firſt booke of Diſcipline, <hi>Anno</hi> 1560. as yee haue often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed. For the wordes in that booke touching this point of Biſhops dutie, are theſe:
<q>
                     <hi>After the Superintendents haue remayned in their chiefe Townes, three or foure moneths at the moſt, they ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled (vnleſſe by ſickneſſe onely they be retayned) to re-enter in their Viſitation. In which they ſhall not onely preach, but alſo examine the life, diligence, and behauiour of the Miniſters, as alſo the order of their Churches, and manners of their people:
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:26266:209"/>They muſt further conſider, how the poore are prouided for, and the youth inſtructed.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>By theſe wordes it is manifeſt, that it was not a thing common to euery Paſtor to viſite Churches, and trie the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of Miniſters, ſpecially concerning their inſtruction of the youth, but that it was proper to the Superintendent. Now, if yee haue ſworne that this is lawfull in the perſon of the Superintendent, how can yee call it a damnable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in the perſon of a Biſhop? whoſe function and name is the ſame, differing onely in the origination of the word, the one being drawne from the Latine, the other from the Greeke: for a Biſhop in the Greeke tongue is the ſame that a Superintendent is in the Latine. And in viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Churches, the triall of the education of children, which now is a dutie belonging to the Biſhops function, is here ſet downe as a ſpeciall point of the Superintendents office.</p>
               <p>As to the bleſſing which the Biſhop is appointed to giue vnto them, <hi>Caluine</hi> in the place aboue cited, ſayes, That it ſhould bee vſed to the end, that graue and ſacred action, may haue the greater reuerence and dignitie. This exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of children in the ancient Church, had ioyned with it, not the bleſſing onely, but the ceremonie alſo of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands; and thereupon in the fourth Councell of Carthage, <hi>Can.</hi> 85. It is called, <hi>Examinatio impoſitionis manus,</hi> and is appointed to be often vſed towards the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techumeniſts before they were baptiſed. But this bleſſing and impoſition of hands vpon the Catechumeniſts, and vpon the young children of Chriſtians, was not the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall action, nor a Sacramentall rite, as it was after eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; nor giuen to Biſhops for honour of their Epiſcopall dignitie, but acceſſorie onely, as <hi>Caluine</hi> rightly thinks, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the examination, which was the Biſhops ſpeciall dutie in his Viſitation. It is true, the omiſſion of the principall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and the vſing onely of the acceſſorie, to wit, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:26266:209"/>of hands, was the firſt corruption, that crept in: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that came in the croſſing, the annointing of the forehead and the buffet giuen to the child in ſtead of the bleſſing, and ſo a Baſtard Sacrament was inſtituted in the place of a moſt profitable point of the Epiſcopall function. Further, as it is the dutie of euery Paſtor, to catechize the young children in his Pariſh, and try whether the Parents haue kept their promiſe made at the Baptiſme of their Children, in which tryall, if hee ſhall finde the childe to haue profited well, hee ought to bleſſe and pray for them: So is it the Biſhops dutie in his Viſitation to try if the Paſtors haue performed their parts, and after examination, to bleſſe theſe ſame children. And as the examination, and bleſſing vſed by the Paſtor, takes not away the power, that parents haue to examine and bleſſe their owne children; ſo the examination and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Biſhops takes not away the power that Paſtors haue of triall, and bleſſing within their owne Pariſh. Therefore to conclude, the Ordinance ſet downe in the Act of Perth appropriates nothing to Biſhops, that is common to Paſtors and Parents, but preſerues vnto euery one the prerogatiue of his owne calling: Neither is there any thing ordayned in the Act, but that which <hi>Caluine</hi> wiſhed ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to be reſtored againe in the Church.</p>

Talem ergo manuum impoſitionem, qua ſimpliciter loco benedictionis fiat laudo, &amp; reſtitutam hodie in purum vſum velim:</hi> that is to ſay, It was the cuſtome of old, that the children of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, after they were growne vp to ſome perfection, were brought vnto the Biſhop to performe that dutie which was done by theſe that were of perfit yeares, before they came to be baptiſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For theſe ſate amongſt the Catechumeniſts, while they were ſufficiently inſtructed in the myſteries of Religion, and were able to giue a confeſſion of their Faith before the Biſhop and the People. But ſuch as were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in their infancy, becauſe they had not giuen a confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Faith vnto the Church, about the end of their childhood they were preſented by their Parents of new, and examined by the Biſhop according to a certayne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon forme of Catechiſme, which they had in theſe times. And to the end, this action, that was in it ſelfe graue and holy, might haue the greater reuerence and dignitie, the ceremonie of impoſition of hands was alſo vſed. Thus the child after approbation of his Faith, was dimitted with a bleſſing, &amp;c. Such an impoſition of hands which is vſed for a ſimple bleſſing, I commend, doe and wiſh the ſincere vſe thereof were reſtored.</p>

And the beſt manner of catechizing were this; That a forme ſhould be penned for that vſe, contayning the ſumme of all the heads of our Religion, and expounding them familiarly, vnto which Faith and Religion the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Church of the faithfull ſhould agree: that the child be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ten yeares old, ſhould preſent himſelfe to the Church, to giue a confeſſion of his Faith: bee demanded vpon euery Article, and made to anſwere ſeuerally to euery one: and if hee were ignorant of any point, or did not well vnderſtand the ſame, he ſhould be inſtructed.

            <p>Firſt, The publike actions of Chriſtian Religion, are not tyed to any certayne time, or place by diuine Inſtitution, but may bee lawfully performed at any time, and in any place, when neceſſity requires.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the publike actions may be lawfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, a publike Miniſter, a lawfull Aſſembly, and the forme preſcribed in the Word, muſt neceſſarily be kept.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Howbeit ſome hold, that Baptiſme miniſtred by a priuate perſon is valide, and effectuall, yet no man can hold truely, that it is lawfully miniſtred by ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Although the Communion Elements bee duly conſecrated by a publike Miniſter in a moſt ſolemne and lawfull Aſſembly, yet if he apply them only to his owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate vſe, or to ſo me other particular perſon, making no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution according to the Inſtitution, the action is not lawfully performed.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, The lawfull Aſſemblies, wherein the publike acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:26266:212"/>may be performed, are eyther ordinary, or not ordinarie. The ordinary are not defined in the word particularly, but are left to bee determined by the Church, which according to the generall Rules of Chriſtian Policie, hath deuided the Chriſtian people in ſundry Congregations called Pariſhes; whoſe meeting in the ordinary times and places appointed, are the ordinary Aſſemblies, wherein the puolike actions of Religion ſhould be performed ordinarily.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, The Aſſemblies that are lawfull, but not ordinary, are the meetings of two, or three at leaſt in the Name of Ieſus Chriſt, wherein he hath promiſed his preſence to heare their Prayers, and approue their lawfull actions of piety. In ſuch Aſſemblies, the Word hath beene preached, and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme miniſtred, as in the 16. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> the Maſter of the Priſon, and his Family were baptized by <hi>Paul.</hi> The Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, the Wife, and a Seruant make a Family, where there be no more. The Family of <hi>Priſcilla</hi> and <hi>Aquila,</hi> are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Church. This Pamphleter affirmes with Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine, Paulinus, Eſychius, Theophylactus,</hi> and others, That our Sauiour at Emaus, did celebrate the Sacrament to the two Diſciples, with whom he communed in the way. There the whole Aſſembly were but three: whether the Sacrament was miniſtred, or not at that time, this is certaine; as many as hold, that the ſame was celebrated, muſt alſo hold, that three make the bodie of a Church, wherein the Euchariſt may be lawfully miniſtred: and if the Euchariſt, much more Baptiſme, which was miniſtred by <hi>Philip</hi> to the Eunuch, where there was no Chriſtian Aſſembly conuened. Yet doubtleſſe, he was baptiſed in preſence of his Seruants who were witneſſes to the action. For Baptiſme would be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in preſence of ſome witneſſes, and the Euchariſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be lawfully miniſtred without ſome communicants.

As to the Maſſe, it is not a priuate Maſſe, where diſtribution is made, but where the Prieſt receiues alone: otherwiſe ye muſt graunt, that it was a priuate Maſſe, that Chriſt celebrated at Emmaus, where two onely did participate and receiue from our Sauiour.

               <p>The neceſſarie Doctrine ought not to be omitted, and the act ordaines Baptiſme in priuate houſes to be miniſtred after the ſame forme that in the Congregation. Doctrine at the baptiſing of Infants, is not vſed for the inſtruction and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the Infant, but for the inſtruction and comfort of the Parents and witneſſes. Though it be abridged in times of extremitie, it diminiſhes not the dignitie of Baptiſme, but the Sacrament is rather highly aduanced, when it is eſteemed to be ſufficient by it ſelfe as the ordinary meane of ſaluation to the infant. In the generall Councell of Conſtantinople, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the Emperour <hi>Constantinus</hi> his Palace in a roome cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Trullus, two Canons are ſet downe, of which yee cite the 59. onely: forgetting according to your cuſtome, the Canon preceding touching Baptiſme, the words whereof are theſe: <hi>Clericos, qui in Oratorijs quae ſunt intra domos ministrant, vel baptizant, hoc illius loci Epiſcopi ſententia facere decernimus, qui hoc non ſic ſeruauerit, deponatur.</hi> The Canon ordaines theſe that baptize in priuate Oratories, to doe it by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops appoyntment. And that cited by you is not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictorie to this, but concerneth the ordinarie adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Baptiſme, whereas vpon extraordinarie conſiderations of infirmitie, and inhabilitie of perſons, the Councell ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges, that the ſame may be done vpon the Biſhops ſpeciall licence. So your <hi>Nullatenus</hi> includes not caſes of neceſſitie.

               <p>To conclude, to deny a neceſſarie comfort vnto the ſick, which may bee miniſtred without breach of any diuine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, cures not the publike infirmitie of the Church, but grieues the ſicke, and foſters in theſe who are in health, a baſe opinion, and contempt of the Sacrament.</p>
